<div class="figleft">

<p>
y name is Mary Cary. I live in the
Yorkburg Female Orphan Asylum.
You may think nothing happens in
an Orphan Asylum. It does. The
orphans are sure enough children, and
real much like the kind that have
Mothers and Fathers; but though they don't
give parties or wear truly Paris clothes, things
happen, and that's why I am going to write
this story.</p>

<p>To-day I was kept in. Yesterday, too. I
don't mind, for I would rather watch the lightning
up here than be down in the basement
with the others. There are days when I love
thunder and lightning. I can't flash and crash,
being just Mary Cary; but I'd like to, and when
it is done for me it is a relief to my feelings.</p>

<p>The reason I was kept in was this. Yesterday
Mr. Gaffney, the one with a sunk eye and
cold in his head perpetual, came to talk to us
for the benefit of our characters. He thinks
it's his duty, and, just naturally loving to talk,
he wears us out once a week anyhow. Yesterday,
not agreeing with what he said, I
wouldn't pretend I did, and I was punished
prompt, of course.</p>

<p>I don't care for duty-doers, and I tried not
to listen to him; but tiresome talk is hard not
to hear&mdash;it makes you so mad. Hear him I did,
and when, after he had ambled on until I
thought he really was castor-oil and I had
swallowed him, he blew his nose and said:</p>

<p>"You have much, my children, to be thankful
for, and for everything you should be thankful.
Are you? If so, stand up. Rise, and
stand upon your feet."</p>

<p>I didn't rise. All the others did&mdash;stood on
their feet, just like he asked. None tried their
heads. I was the only one that sat, and when
he saw me, his sunk eye almost rolled out, and
his good eye stared at me in such astonishment
that I laughed out loud. I couldn't help it,
I truly couldn't.</p>

<p>I'm not thankful for everything, and that's
why I didn't stand up. Can you be thankful
for toothache, or stomachache, or any kind of
ache? You cannot. And not meant to be,
either.</p>

<p>The room got awful still, and then presently
he said:</p>

<p>"Mary Cary"&mdash;his voice was worse than his
eye&mdash;"Mary Cary, do you mean to say you have
not a thankful heart?" And he pointed his
finger at me like I was the Jezebel lady come
to life.</p>

<p>I didn't answer, thinking it safer, and he
asked again:</p>

<p>"Do I understand, Mary Cary"&mdash;and by
this time he was real red-in-the-face mad&mdash;"do
I understand you are not thankful for all that
comes to you? Do I understand aright?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, you understand right," I said,
getting up this time. "I am not thankful for
everything in my life. I'd be much thankfuller
to have a Mother and Father on earth
than to have them in heaven. And there are
a great many other things I would like different."
And down I sat, and was kept in for
telling the truth.</p>

<p>Miss Bray says it was for impertinence (Miss
Bray is the Head Chief of this Institution),
but I didn't mean to be impertinent. I truly
didn't. Speaking facts is apt to make trouble,
though&mdash;also writing them. To-day Miss Bray
kept me in for putting something on the blackboard
I forgot to rub out. I wrote it just for
my own relief, not thinking about anybody else
seeing it. What I wrote was this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"Some people are crazy all the time;<br /></span>
<span>All people are crazy sometimes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That's why I'm up in the punishment-room
to-day, and it only proves that what I wrote is
right. It's crazy to let people know you know
how queer they are. Miss Bray takes personal
everything I do, and when she saw that blackboard,
up-stairs she ordered me at once. She
loves to punish me, and it's a pleasure I give
her often.</p>

<p>I brought my diary with me, and as I can't
write when anybody is about, I don't mind
being by myself every now and then. Miss
Bray don't know this, or my punishment would
take some other form.</p>

<p>I just love a diary. You see, its something
you can tell things to and not get in trouble.
When writing in it I can relieve my feelings by
saying what I think, which Miss Katherine says
is risky to do to people, and that it's safer to
keep your feelings to yourself. People don't
really care about them, and there's nothing
they get so tired of hearing about. A diary
doesn't talk, neither do animals; but a diary
understands better than animals, and you can
call things by their right name in a book which
it isn't safe to do out loud, even to a dog.</p>

<p>I know I am not unthankful, and I would
much rather have a Father and Mother on
earth than to have them in heaven, but I guess
I should have kept my preferences to myself.
Somehow preferences seem to make people mad.</p>

<p>But a Mother and Father in heaven <i>are</i> too
far away to be truly comforting. I like the
people I love to be close to me. I guess that
is why, when I was little, I used to hold out my
arms at night, hoping my Mother would come
and hold me tight. But she never came, and
now I know it's no use.</p>

<p>There are a great many things that are no
use. One is in telling people what they don't
want to know. I found that out almost two
years ago, when I wasn't but ten. The way
I found out was this.</p>

<p>One morning, it was an awful cold morning,
Miss Bray came into the dining-room just as
we were taking our seats for breakfast, and she
looked so funny that everybody stared, though
nobody dared to even smile visible. All the
children are afraid of Miss Bray; but at that
time I hadn't found out her true self, and, not
thinking of consequences, I jumped up and ran
over to her and whispered something in her ear.</p>

<p>"What!" she said. "What did you say?"
And she bent her head so as to hear better.</p>

<p>"You forgot one side of your face when fixing
this morning," I said, still whispering, not
wanting the others to hear. "Only one side is
pink&mdash;" But I didn't get any further, for she
grabbed my hand and almost ran with me out
of the room.</p>

<p>"You piece of impertinence!" she said, and
her eyes had such sparks in them I knew my
judgment-day had come. "You little piece
of impertinence! You shall be punished well
for this." I was. I didn't mean to be impertinent.
I thought she'd like to know. I
thought wrong.</p>

<p>I loathe Miss Bray. The very sight of her
shoulders in the back gets me mad all over
without her saying a word, and everything in
me that's wrong comes right forward and
speaks out when she and I are together. She
thinks she could run this earth better than it's
being done, and she walks like she was the
Superintendent of most of it. But I could
stand that. I could stand her cheeks, and her
frizzed front, and a good many other things;
but what I can't stand is her passing for being
truthful when she isn't. She tells stories, and
she knows I know it; and from the day I found
it out I have stayed out of her way; and were
she the Queen of Europe, Asia, and Africa, and
the United States I'd want her to stand out of
mine. I truly would.</p>

<p>Her outrageousest story I heard her tell myself.
It was over a year ago, and we were in
the room where the ladies were having a
Board meeting. I had come in to bring some
water, and had a waiter full of glasses in my
hands, and was just about to put them on the
table when I heard Miss Bray tell her Lie.</p>

<p>That's what she did. She Lied!</p>

<p>Those glasses never touched that table.
My hands lost their hold, and down they came
with a crash. Every one smashed to smithereens,
and I standing staring at Miss Bray.
The way she told her story was this. The
Board deals us out for adoption, and that
morning they were discussing a request for
Pinkie Moore, and, as usual, Miss Bray didn't
want Pinkie to go. You see, Pinkie was very
useful. She did a lot of disagreeable things for
Miss Bray, and Miss Bray didn't want to lose
her. And when Mrs. Roane, who is the only
Board lady truly seeing through her, asked, real
sharplike, why Pinkie shouldn't go this time,
Miss Bray spoke out like she was really grieved.</p>

<p>"I declare, Mrs. Roane," she said&mdash;and she
twirled her keys round and round her fingers,
and twitched the nostril parts of her nose
just like a horse&mdash;"I declare, Mrs. Roane, I
hate to tell you, I really do. But Pinkie Moore
wouldn't do for adoption. She has a terrible
temper, and she's so slow nobody would keep
her. And then, too"&mdash;her voice was the
Pharisee kind that the Lord must hate worse
than all others&mdash;"and then, too, I am sorry
to say Pinkie is not truthful, and has been
caught taking things from the girls. I hope
none of you will mention this, as I trust by
watching over her to correct these faults. She
begs me so not to send her out for adoption,
and is so devoted to me that&mdash;" And just
then she saw me, which she hadn't done before,
I being behind Mrs. Armstead, and she stopped
like she had been hit.</p>

<p>For a minute I didn't breathe. I didn't.
All I did was to stare&mdash;stare with mouth open
and eyes out; and then it was the glasses went
down and I flew into the yard, and there by
the pump was Pinkie.</p>

<p>"Oh, Pinkie!" I said. "Oh, Pinkie!" And I
caught her round the waist and raced up and
down the yard like a wild man from Borneo.
"Oh, Pinkie, what do you think?" Poor Pinkie,
thinking a mad dog had bit me, tried to make
me stop, but stop I wouldn't until there was
no more breath. And then we sat down on
the woodpile, and I hugged her so hard I
almost broke her bones.</p>

<p>First I was so mad I couldn't cry, and then
crying so I couldn't speak. But after a while
words came, and I said:</p>

<p>"Pinkie Moore, are you devoted to Miss
Bray? Are you? I want the truest truth.
Are you devoted to her?"</p>

<p>"Devoted to Miss Bray? Devoted!" And
poor little Pinkie, who has no more spirit than
a poor relation, spoke out for once. "I hate
her!" she said. "I hate her worse than prunes;
and if somebody would only adopt me, I'd be
so thankful I'd choke for joy, except for leaving
you." Then she boohoo'd too, and the
tears that fell between us looked like we were
artesian wells&mdash;they certainly did.</p>

<p>But Pinkie didn't know what caused my
tears. Mine were mad tears, and not being
able to tell her why they came, I had to send
her to the house to wash her face. I washed
mine at the pump, and then worked off some
of my mad by sweeping the yard as hard as I
could, wishing all the time Miss Bray was the
leaves, and trying to make believe she was. I
was full of the things the Bible says went into
swine, and I knew there would be trouble for
me before the day was out. But there wasn't.
Not even for breaking the pump-handle was I
punished, and Miss Bray tried so hard to be
friendly that at first I did not understand. I
do now.</p>

<p>That was my first experience in finding out
that some one who looked like a lady on the
outside was mean and deceitful on the inside,
and it made me tremble all over to find it could
be so. Since then I have never pretended to
be friends with Miss Bray. As for her, she
hates me&mdash;hates me because she knows I know
what sort of a person she is, a sort I loathe
from my heart.</p>

<p>When I first got my diary I thought I was
going to write in it every day. I haven't, and
that shows I'm no better on resolves than I
am on keeping step. I never keep step. Sometimes
I've thought I was really something, but
I'm not. Nobody much is when you know
them too well. It is a good thing for your
pride when you keep a diary, specially when
you are truthful in it. Each day that you
leave out is an evidence of character&mdash;poor
character&mdash;for it shows how careless and put-off-y
you are; both of which I am.</p>

<p>But it isn't much in life to be an inmate of a
Humane Association, or a Home, or an Asylum,
or whatever name you call the place where job-lot
charity children live. And that's what I
am, an Inmate. Inmates are like malaria and
dyspepsia: something nobody wants and every
place has. Minerva James says they are like
veterans&mdash;they die and yet forever live.</p>

<p>Well, anyhow, whenever I used to do wrong,
which was pretty constant, I would say to
myself it didn't matter, nobody cared. And
if I let a chance slip to worry Miss Bray I was
sorry for it; but that was before I understood
her, and before Miss Katherine came. Since
Miss Katherine came I know it's yourself that
matters most, not where you live or where
you came from, and I'm thinking a little more
of Mary Cary than I used to, though in a different
way. As for Miss Bray, I truly try at
times to forget she's living.</p>

<p>But she's taught me a good deal about Human
Nature, Miss Bray has. About the side
I didn't know. It's a pity there are things
we have to know. I think I will make a special
study of Human Nature. I thought once I'd
take up Botany in particular, as I love flowers;
or Astronomy, so as to find out all about those
million worlds in the sky, so superior to earth,
and so much larger; but I think, now, I'll settle
on Human Nature. Nobody ever knows what
it is going to do, which makes it full of surprises,
but there's a lot that's real interesting
about it. I like it. As for its Bray side, I'll
try not to think about it; but if there are
puddles, I guess it's well to know where, so as
not to step in them. I wish we didn't have
to know about puddles and things! I'd so
much rather know little and be happy than
find out the miserable much some people do.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I won't have to remember all I
learn, for Miss Katherine says there are many
things it's wise to forget, and whenever I can
I'll forget mean things. I'd forget Miss Bray's
if she'd tell me she was sorry and cross her
heart she'd never do them again. But I don't
believe she ever will. God is going to have a
hard time with Miss Bray. She's right old to
change, and she's set in her ways&mdash;bad ways.</p>

<h2>THE COMING OF MISS KATHERINE</h2>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/n.png" alt="N" title="N" /></div><p>
ow, why can't I keep on at a thing
like Miss Katherine? Why? Because
I'm just Mary Cary, mostly Martha;
made of nothing, came from nowhere,
and don't know where I'm going, and
have no more system in my nature
than Miss Bray has charms for gentlemen.</p>

<p>But Miss Katherine&mdash;well, there never was
and never will be but one Miss Katherine, and
there's as much chance of my being like her as
there is of my reaching the stars. I'll never
be like her, but she's my friend. That's the
wonderful part of it. She's my friend. And
when you've got a friend like Miss Katherine
you've got strength to do anything. To stand
anything, too.</p>

<p>The beautiful part of it is that I live with
her; that is, she lives in the Asylum, and I
sleep in the room with her.</p>

<p>It happened this way. Last summer I didn't
want to do anything but sit down. It was the
funniest thing, for before that I never did like
to sit down if I could stand up, or skip around,
or climb, or run, or dance, or jump. I never
could walk straight or slow, and I never can
keep step.</p>

<p>Well, last summer I didn't want to move,
and I couldn't eat, and I didn't even feel like
reading. I'd have such queer slipping-away
feelings right in my heart that I'd call myself
a drop of ink on a blotter that was spreading
and spreading and couldn't stop. Sometimes I
would think I was sinking down and down,
but I really wasn't sinking, for I didn't move.
I only felt like I was, and I was afraid to go
to sleep at night for fear I would die, and I
stayed awake so as to know about it if I did.</p>

<p>And then I began to be afraid of dying, and
my heart would beat so I thought it would wear
out. But I didn't tell anybody how I felt. I
was ashamed of being afraid, and I just told
God, because I knew He could understand better
than anybody else; and I asked Him please
to hold on to me, I not being able to do much
holding myself, and He held. I know it, for I
felt it.</p>

<p>You see, Mrs. Blamire&mdash;she's Miss Bray's assistant&mdash;was
away; Miss Bray was busy getting
ready to go when Mrs. Blamire came back; and
Miss Jones was pickling and preserving. I
didn't want to bother her, so I dragged on, and
kept my feelings to myself.</p>

<p>The girls were awful good to me. Real many
have relations in Yorkburg, and if I'd eaten all
the fruit they sent me I'd been a tutti-frutti;
but I couldn't eat it. And then one day I began
to talk so queer they were frightened, and
told Miss Bray, and she sent for the doctor
quick. That afternoon they took me to the
hospital, and the last thing I saw was little
Josie White crying like her heart would break
with her arms around a tree.</p>

<p>"Please don't die, Mary Cary, please don't
die!" she kept saying over and over, and when
they tried to make her go in she bawled worse
than ever. I tried to wave my hand.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to die, I'm coming back," I
said, and that's all I remember.</p>

<p>I knew they put me in something and drove
off, and then I was in a little white bed in a big
room with a lot of other little beds in it; and
after that I didn't know I was living for three
weeks. But I talked just the same. They told me I
made speeches by the hour, and read books
out loud, and recited poems that had never
been printed. But when I stopped and lay like
the dead, just breathing, the girls say they heard
there were no hopes, and a lot of them just
cried and cried. It was awful nice of them,
and if they hadn't cut my hair off I would have
made a real pretty corpse.</p>

<p>The day I first saw Miss Katherine really
good she was standing by my bed, holding my
wrist in one hand and her watch in another,
and I thought she was an angel and I was in
heaven. She was in white, and I took her
little white cap for a crown, and I said:</p>

<p>"Are you my Mother?"</p>

<p>She nodded and smiled, but she didn't speak,
and I asked again:</p>

<p>"Are you my Mother?"</p>

<p>"Your right-now Mother," she said, and she
smiled so delicious I thought of course I was
in heaven, and I spoke once more.</p>

<p>"Where's God?"</p>

<p>Then she stooped down and kissed me.</p>

<p>"In your heart and mine," she answered.
"But you mustn't talk, not yet. Shut your
eyes, and I will sing you to sleep." And I
shut them. And I knew I was in heaven, for
heaven isn't a place; it's a feeling, and I had it.</p>

<p>And that's how I met Miss Katherine.</p>

<p>Her father and mother are dead, just like mine.
Her father was Judge Trent, and his father
once owned half the houses in Yorkburg, but
lost them some way, and what he didn't lose
Judge Trent did after the war.</p>

<p>When her father died Miss Katherine wouldn't
live with either of her brothers, or any of her
relations, but went to Baltimore to study to be
a nurse. After she graduated she didn't come
back for three or four years, and she hadn't
been back six months when I was taken sick.
And now I sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"Praise God from whom that sickness flew."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sing it inside almost all the time.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine don't have to be a nurse.
She has a little money. I don't know how
much, she never mentioning money before me;
but she has some, for I heard Miss Bray and
Mrs. Blamire talking one night when they
thought I was asleep; and for once I didn't interrupt
or let them know I was awake.</p>

<p>I had been punished so often for speaking
when I shouldn't that this time I kept quiet,
and when they were through I couldn't sleep.
I was so excited I stayed awake all night. And
from joy&mdash;pure joy.</p>

<p>I had only been back from the hospital a
week, and was in the room next to Mrs. Blamire's,
where the children who are sick stay,
when I heard Miss Bray talking to Mrs. Blamire,
and at something she said I sat up in bed.
Right or wrong, I tried to hear. I did.</p>

<p>They were sitting in front of the fire, and
Miss Bray leaned over and cracked the coals.</p>

<p>"Have you heard that Miss Katherine Trent
is coming here as a trained nurse?" she said,
and she put down the poker, and, folding her
arms, began to rock.</p>

<p>"You don't mean it!" said Mrs. Blamire, and
her little voice just cackled. "Coming here?
To this place? I do declare!" And she drew
her chair up closer, being a little deaf.</p>

<p>"That's what she's going to do." Miss Bray
took off her spectacles. "The Board can't
afford to pay her a salary, but she's offered to
come without one, and next week she'll start
in."</p>

<p>"Katherine Trent always was queer," she
went on, still rocking with all her might. "She
can get big prices as a nurse, though she doesn't
have to nurse at all, having money enough to
live on without working. And why she wants
to come to a place like this and fool with fifty-odd
children and get no pay for it is beyond
my understanding. It's her business, however,
not mine, and I'm glad she's coming."</p>

<p>"I do declare!" And Mrs. Blamire clapped
her hands like she was getting religion. "My,
but I'm glad! Miss Katherine Trent coming
here! And next week, you say? I do declare!"
And her gladness sounded in her
voice. It was a different kind from Miss
Bray's. Even in the dark I could tell, for
hers was thankfulness for the children. Miss
Bray was glad for herself.</p>

<p>That was almost a year ago, and now my
hair has come out and curls worse than ever.
It's very thick, and it's brown&mdash;light brown.</p>

<p>I'm always intending to stand still in front
of the glass long enough to see what I do look
like, but I'm always in such a hurry I don't
have time. I know my eyes are blue, for Miss
Katherine said this morning they got bigger
and bluer every day, and if I didn't eat more
I'd be nothing but eyes. If you don't like a
thing, can you eat it? You cannot. That is, in
summer you can't. In winter it's a little easier.</p>

<p>I never have understood how Miss Katherine
could have come to an Orphan Asylum to live
and to eat Orphan Asylum meals when she
could have eaten the best in Yorkburg. And
Yorkburg's best is the best on earth. Everybody
says that who's tried other places, even
Miss Webb, who gets right impatient with
Yorkburg's slowness and enjoyment of itself.</p>

<p>And Miss Katherine is living here from pure
choice. That's what she is doing, and she's
made living creatures of us, just like God did
when He breathed on Adam and woke him up.</p>

<p>At the hospital she used to ask me all about
the Asylum, and, never guessing why, I told
her all I knew, except about Miss Bray. Miss
Katherine had known the Asylum all her life,
but had only been in it twice&mdash;just passing it
by, not thinking. When I got better and
could talk as much as I pleased, she wanted
to know how many of us there were, what we
did, and how we did it: what we ate, and
what kind of underclothes we wore in winter,
and how many times a week we bathed all
over; when we got up, and what we studied,
and how long we sewed each day, and how long
we played, and when we went to bed&mdash;and all
sorts of other things. I wondered why she
wanted to know, and when I found out I could
have laid right down and died from pure gladness.
I didn't, though.</p>

<p>Once I asked her what made her do it, and
she laughed and said because she wanted to, and
that she was much obliged to me for having found
her work for her. But I believe there's some
other reason she won't tell.</p>

<p>And why I believe so is that sometimes, when
she thinks I am asleep, I see her looking in the
fire, and there's something in her face that's
never there at any other time. It's a remembrance.
I guess most hearts have them if they
live long enough. But you'd never think Miss
Katherine had one, she's so glad and cheerful
and busy all the time. I wonder if it's a sweetheart
remembrance? I know three of her
beaux; one in Yorkburg and two from away,
who have been to see her frequent times; but
a beau is different from a sweetheart. I'm sure
that look means something secret, and I bet
it's a man. Who is he? I don't know. I
wish he was dead. I do!</p>

<p>When I first came back from the hospital
my little old sticks of legs wouldn't hold me
up, and down I would go. But I didn't mind
that. I just minded not going to sleep at
night. But sleep wouldn't come, and I'd get
so wide awake trying to make it that I began
to have a teeny bit of fever again, and then it
was Miss Katherine asked if she might take
me in her room. I was nervous and still needed
attention, she said, and&mdash;magnificent gloriousness!&mdash;I
was sent to her room to stay until perfectly
well, and I'm here yet. Perfectly well
because I am here!</p>

<p>That first night when I got into the little
white bed next to her bed, and knew she was
going to be there beside me, I couldn't go to
sleep right off. I kept wishing I was King
David, so I could write a book of gratitudes
and psalms and praises, and that was the first
night I ever really prayed right. I didn't ask
for a thing except for help to be worth it&mdash;the
trouble she was taking for just little me, a
charity child. Just me!</p>

<p>And oh, the difference in her room and the
room I had left! She had had it painted and
papered herself, for it hadn't been used since
kingdom come, and the cobwebs in it would
have filled a barrel. It had been a packing-room,
and when Miss Katherine first saw it
she just whistled soft and easy; but when she
was through, it was just a dream.</p>

<p>It is a big room at the end of the wing, and
it has three windows in it: one in the front and
one in the back and one opposite the door you
come in. And when the paper was put on
you felt like you were in a great big garden of
roses; pink roses, for they were running all
over the walls, and they were so natural I
could smell them. I really could.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine brought her own furniture
and things, and she put a carpet on the floor,
all over, not just strips. And the windows had
muslin curtains at them with cretonne curtains
just full of pink roses, looped back from the
muslin ones; and the couch and the cushions
and some chairs were all covered with the same
kind of pink roses. And as for the bed, it was
too sweet for anybody to lie on&mdash;that is, for
anybody but Miss Katherine to lie on.</p>

<p>There was a big closet for her clothes, and
a writing-desk which had been in the family a
hundred years&mdash;maybe a thousand. I don't
know. And one side of the room was filled
with books in shelves which old Peter Sands
made and painted white for her. She lets me
look at them as much as I want, and says I can
read as many as I choose when I am old enough
to understand them. She didn't mention any
time to begin trying to understand, and so I
started at once, and I've read about forty
already.</p>

<p>There aren't a great many pictures on Miss
Katherine's walls. Just a few besides the portraits
of her father and mother, oil paintings.
And oh, dear children what are to be, I'm going
to have my picture painted as soon as I marry
your father, so you can know what I looked
like in case I should die without warning. I
want you to have it, knowing so well what it
means to have nothing that belonged to your
mother, I not having anything&mdash;not even a
strand of hair or a message.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder if I ever really did have
a Mother, or if the doctor just left me somewhere
and nobody wanted me. I must have
had one, for Betty Johnson says a baby's bound
to. That a father isn't so specially necessary,
but you've got to have a Mother. Mine died
when I was born. I wonder how that happened
when there wasn't anybody in all this great
big earth to take care of me except my father,
who didn't know how. He died, too, and then
I was an Orphan.</p>

<p>This is a strange world, and it's better not to
try to understand things.</p>

<p>In the winter time Miss Katherine always
has a beautiful crackling fire in her room, and
some growing flowers and green things. It was
a revelation to the girls, her room was. Not
fine, and it didn't cost much, but you felt nicer
and kinder the minute you went in it. And
it made Mrs. Reagan's grand parlors seem like
shining brass and tinkling cymbals. I wonder
why?</p>

<h2>MARY, FREQUENTLY MARTHA</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i.png" alt="I" title="I" /></div><p>
 am going to write a history of my
life. The things that happen in this
place are the same things, just like
our breakfasts, dinners, and suppers.
They wouldn't be interesting to hear
about, so while waiting for something
real exciting to put down, I am going to write
my history.</p>

<p>I don't know very much about who I am. I
wish my Mother had left a diary about herself,
but she didn't. Nobody, not even Miss Katherine,
will tell me who I was before I came here,
which I did when I was three. I know my
nurse brought me, but I can't remember what
she looked like, and when she went away without
me: I never saw nor heard of her again.
I don't even know her name. I thought it was
fine to play in a big yard with a lot of children,
and I soon stopped crying for my nurse.</p>

<p>I never did see much sense in crying. Everybody
was good to me, and not being old enough
to know I was a Charity child, and by nature
happy, they used to call me Cricket. Sometimes
some of them call me that now.</p>

<p>A hundred dozen times I have asked Miss
Katherine to tell me something about myself,
but in some way she always gets out of it. I
know my mother and father are dead, but that's
all I do know; and I wouldn't ask Miss Bray
if I had to stand alone for ever and ever.</p>

<p>Sometimes I believe Miss Katherine knows
something she won't tell me, but since I found
out she don't like me to ask her I've stopped.
And not being able to ask out what I'd like, I
think a lot more, and some nights when I can't
go to sleep, it gives me an awful sinking feeling
right down in my stomach, to think in all this
great big world there isn't a human that's any
kin to me.</p>

<p>I might have come from the heavens above
or the depths below, only I didn't, and being
like other girls in size and shape and feelings,
I know I once did have a Mother and Father.
But if they had relations they've kept quiet,
and it's plain they don't want to know anything
about me, never having asked.</p>

<p>It would make me miserable&mdash;this aloneness
would, if I let it. I won't let it. I have got
to look out for Mary Cary, frequently Martha,
and when you're miserable you don't get much
of anything that's going around. I won't be
unhappy. I just won't. I haven't enough
other blessings.</p>

<p>But not being able to speak out as much as
I would like on some things personal, I got
into the habit of talking to my other self, which
I named Martha, and which I call my secret
sister. Martha is my every-day self, like the
Bible Martha who did things, and didn't worry
trying to find out what couldn't be found out,
specially about why God lets Mothers die.</p>

<p>Mary is my Sunday self who wonders and
wonders at everything and asks a million questions
inside, and goes along and lets people
think she is truly Martha when she knows all
the time she isn't. And if I do hold out and
write a history of my life, it's going to be a
Martha and Mary history; for some days I'm
one, some another, and whichever I happen
to be is plain to be seen.</p>

<p>When I grow up I am going to marry a
million-dollar man, so I can travel around the
world and have a house in Paris with twenty
bath-rooms in it. And I'm going to have horses
and automobiles and a private car and balloons,
if they are working all right by that time. I
hope they will be, for I want something in
which I can soar up and sit and look down on
other people.</p>

<p>All my life people have looked down on me,
passing me by like I was a Juny bug or a
caterpillar, and I don't wonder. I'm merely
Mary Cary with fifty-eight more just like me.
Blue calico, white dots for winter, white calico,
blue dots for summer. Black sailor hats and
white sailor hats with blue capes for cold
weather, and no fire to dress by, and freezing
fingers when it's cold, and no ice-water when
it's hot.</p>

<p>Yes, dear Mary, you and I are going to marry
a rich man. (Martha is writing to-day.) I
will try to love him, but if I can't I will be
polite to him and travel alone as much as possible.
But I am going to be rich some day.
I am. And when I come back to Yorkburg
eyes will bulge, for the clothes I am going to
wear will make mouths water, they're going to
be so grand. Miss Katherine would be ashamed
of that and make me ashamed, but this writing
is for the relief of feelings.</p>

<p>But there's one thing I'm surer of than I
am of being rich, and that is that there are
to be no secrets about my children's mother.
They are to know all about me I can tell, which
won't be much or distinguished, but what there
is they're to know. And that's the chief reason
I'm going to write my history, so as to remember
in case I forget.</p>

<p>Well, now I will begin. I am eleven years
and eleven months and three days old. I don't
have birthday parties. The Yorkburg Female
Orphan Asylum is a large house with a wide
hall in the middle, and a wing on one side that
makes it look like Major Green, who lost one
arm in the war.</p>

<p>There are large grounds around the house,
and around the grounds is a high brick wall
in front and a wooden fence back and sides.
The children and the chickens use the grounds
at the back; the front has grass and flowers, and
is for company, which is seldom. Sometimes,
just because I can't help it, I chase a chicken
through the front so as to know how it feels to
run in the grass, which it is forbidden to do.</p>

<p>Forbidden things are so much nicer than unforbidden.
I love to do them until they're
done.</p>

<p>The Asylum is on King Street, almost at the
very end, and there isn't much passing, just
the Tates and the Gordons and a few others
living farther on. The dining-room is in the
basement, half below the ground, and on cloudy
days the lamps have to be lighted&mdash;that is, they
used to. Now we have electric lights, and I
just love to turn them on. It's such a grand
way to get a thing done, just to press a button.</p>

<p>The dining-room has a picture over the
mantel of a cow standing in yellow-brown
grass, and, though hideous, it's a great comfort.
That cow understands our feelings at mealtimes,
and we understand hers.</p>

<p>Humane meals are very much like yellow-brown
grass, and our clothes are on the same
order as our meals. As for our days, if it wasn't
for calendars we wouldn't know one from the
other, except Sundays, for, unlike the stars
mentioned by St. Paul, they differ not.</p>

<p>The rising-bell rings at five o'clock, and all
except the very littlest get up and clean up
until seven, when we march into the dining-room.
At 7.25 we rise at the tap of Miss Bray's
bell, and those who have more cleaning up-stairs
march out; those who clear the table
and wash the dishes stay behind. At 8.30 we
march into the school-room, where we have
prayers and calisthenics. The calisthenics are
fine. At nine we begin recitations.</p>

<p>We have a teacher who lives in town, Miss
Elvira Strother. She's a good teacher. The
older girls help teach the little ones, and next
year I'm to help.</p>

<p>This Asylum is over ninety (90) years old,
but looks much older. There is just money
enough to run it, and it hasn't had any paint
or improvements in the memory of man, except
the electric lights. The town put those
in for safety, and don't charge for them.</p>

<p>I wish the town would put in bath-tubs for
the same reason. It would make the children
much nicer. They just naturally don't like to
wash, and one small pitcher of water for two
girls don't allow much splashing.</p>

<p>But Yorkburg hasn't any water-works, not
being born with them. I mean, water-works
not being the fashion when Yorkburg was first
begun, nobody has ever thought of putting
them in. Mr. Loyall, he's the mayor, says
everybody has gotten on very well for over
two hundred years without them, and he don't
see any use in stirring up the subject. So
there'll never be any change until he's dead,
and in Yorkburg nobody dies till the last
thing.</p>

<p>There wouldn't be any electric lights if the
shoe factory hadn't come here. The men who
brought it came from New Jersey, and they
wanted light, and got it. And Yorkburg was
so pleased that it moved a little and made
some light for itself; and now everything in
town just blazes, even the Asylum.</p>

<p>I used to sleep in No. 4, but I don't sleep
there now. It is a big room, and has six windows
in it, and in winter we children used to
play we were arctic explorers and would search
for icebergs. The North Pole was the Reagan's
house, half-way down the street, and it might
as well have been, for it was as much beyond
our reach.</p>

<p>But it was the one thing we were all going
to get some day when we married rich. And
when we got it, we were going to drive up to
the Galt House&mdash;that's the Home for Poor
and Proud Ladies&mdash;and ask for Mrs. Reagan,
who was to be in it in the third floor back,
and leave her some old clothes with the buttons
off, and old magazines. None of us could bear
Mrs. Reagan&mdash;not a single one.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful house, Mrs. Reagan's is. It
has large white pillars in the front and back,
and it's got three bath-rooms, and a big tank
in the back yard. And it has velvet curtains
over the lace ones, and gold furniture and pictures
with gold frames a foot wide.</p>

<p>I heard Miss Katherine talking about it to
Miss Webb one night. They were laughing
about something Miss Katherine said was the
most impossible of all, and Miss Webb said it
was desecrating for such a stately old house to
fall into the hands of such bulgarians. What
are bulgarians? I don't know. But they're not
ladies.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reagan is not a lady. The way I found
it out was this. Miss Jones, she's our housekeeper,
sent a message to her one day by
Bertha Reed and me about some pickles.
Bertha is awful timid, and she didn't know
whether or not we ought to go to the front
door; but I did, and I told her to come on.</p>

<p>"I don't go to back doors, if I don't know
my family history," I said. "I know who I
am, and something inside of me tells me where
to go." And I pressed the button so hard I
thought I'd broken it unintentional.</p>

<p>The man-servant opened the door and looked
at us as if weary and surprised, and said nothing.</p>

<p>"Is Mrs. Reagan in?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She is."</p>

<p>That's all he said. He waited. I waited.
Then I stepped forward.</p>

<p>"We will come in," I said. "And you go
and tell her Mary Cary would like to see her,
having a message from Miss Jones." And he
was so surprised he moved aside, and in I
walked.</p>

<p>I had heard so much about this house that I
wasn't going to miss seeing what was in it, if
that fool man was rude; so while he was gone
to get Mrs. Reagan I counted everything in the
front parlor as quick as I could, and told
Bertha to count everything in the back.</p>

<p>There were three sofas and two mirrors and
nine chairs and six rugs and six tables and
two pianos, one little old-fashioned one and a
big new one; and three stools and seventeen
candlesticks and four pedestals with statuary
on them, some broken, all naked; and seven
palms and twenty-three pictures and two lamps
and five red-plush curtains, three pairs over the
lace ones and two at the doors; and as for
ornaments, it was a shop. And not one single
book.</p>

<p>I am sure I got the things right, for I'd been
practising remembering at observation parties,
in case I ever got a chance to see inside this
house; and I looked hard so I could tell the
girls.</p>

<p>Poor Bertha was so frightened she didn't remember
anything but the clock and a china
cat and an easel and picture, and before I
could count Mrs. Reagan came in.</p>

<p>She stopped in the doorway, and had we
come from leper-land she couldn't have held
herself farther off.</p>

<p>"What are you doing in here?" she asked,
and she tried the haughty air&mdash;"What are you
doing in here?"</p>

<p>"We were waiting for you," I said. "We
have a message from Miss Jones."</p>

<p>"Well, another time don't wait in here, and
don't come to the front door if you have a
message from Miss Jones or Miss Any-body-else.
I don't want any pickles this year. Had I
wanted any I would have sent her word.
You understand? Don't ever come here again
in this way!" And she waved us out as if we
were flies.</p>

<p>For a minute I looked at her as if she were
a Mrs. Jorley's wax-works, and then I made a
bow like I make in charades.</p>

<p>"We understand," I said. "And we will
not come again. We've heard a good many
people in Yorkburg have been once and no
more." And I bowed again and walked past
her like she was a stage character, which she
was, being a pretence and nothing else.</p>

<p>Mad? I tell you, I was Martha for a week,
and then I saw, real sudden, how silly I was to
let a bulgarian make me mad.</p>

<p>But if I'm ever expected to love anything
like that, it will be expecting too much of Mary
Cary, mostly Martha, for she isn't an enemy.
She's just a make-believe of something she
wasn't born into being and don't know how
to make herself. She don't agree with my
nature, and if I had a parlor she couldn't come
into it either. She could not.</p>

<h2>THE STEPPED-ON AND THE STEPPERS</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i.png" alt="I" title="I" /></div><p>
 don't believe I ever have written
anything about my first years at this
Asylum. I am naturally a wandering
person. Well, I was happy. I
know I've said that before, but Miss
Katherine says that's one of the few
things you can say often.</p>

<p>I had a kitten, and a chicken which I killed
by mistake. I took it to the pump to wash it,
and it lost its breath and died. I still put
flowers on the place where its grave was.</p>

<p>It was my first to die. I have lost many
others since: a cat, and a rabbit, and a rooster
called Napoleon because he was so strutty and
domineering to his wives. I didn't put up anything
to his grave. I didn't think the hens
would like it. They just despised him.</p>

<p>Then there were the remains of Rebecca
Baker. She was of rags, with button eyes and
no teeth, just marks for them; but I loved her
very much. I kept her as long as there was
anything to hold her by; but after legs and
arms went, and the back of her head got so
thin from lack of sawdust that she had neuralgia
all the time, I found her dead one morning,
and buried her at once.</p>

<p>I loved Rebecca Baker: not for looks, but
for comfort. I could talk to her without fear
of her telling. She always knew how hungry
I was, and how I hated oatmeal without sugar,
and she never talked back.</p>

<p>During the years from three to nine I lived
just mechanical, except on the inside. I got
up to a bell and cleaned to a bell, and sat
down to eat to a bell; rose to a bell, went to
school to a bell, came out to a bell, worked to
a bell, sewed to a bell, played to a bell, said
my prayers to a bell, got in bed to a bell, and
the next day and every day did the same thing
over to the same old bell.</p>

<p>But when I marry my children's father there
are to be no bells in the house we live in. Only
buttons, with no particular time to be pressed.</p>

<p>We go to church to a bell, too; that, is to
Sunday-school. We always go to St. John's
Sunday-school&mdash;Episcopal. The man who left
this place put it in his will that we had to, but
we go to all the other churches. Episcopal the
first Sunday, Methodist the second, Presbyterian
the third, and Baptist the fourth, and when we
get through we begin all over again.</p>

<p>We go to church like we do everything else,
two by two. Start at a tap of that same old
bell, and march along like wooden figures
wound up; and the people who see us don't
think we are really truly children or like theirs,
except in shape inside. They think we just
love our hideous clothes, and that we ought
to be thankful for molasses and bread-and-milk
every night in the week but one, and if
we're not, we're wicked. Rich people think
queer things.</p>

<p>Sundays at the Humane are terribly religious.</p>

<p>They begin early and last until after supper,
and if anybody is sorry when Sunday is over,
it's never been mentioned out loud. We have
prayers and Bible-reading before breakfast
every day, but on Sundays longer. Then we
go to Sunday-school, where some of the children
stare at us like we were foreign heathen who
have come to get saved. Some nudge each
other and laugh. But real many are nice and
sweet, and I just love that little Minnie Dawes,
who sits in front of me. She wears the prettiest
hats in Yorkburg, and I get lots of ideas from
them. I trim hats in my mind all the time
Miss Sallie is talking&mdash;- Miss Sallie is our teacher.</p>

<p>She is a good lady, Miss Sallie Ray is. Her
chief occupation is religion, and as for going to
church, it's the true joy of her life. She's in
love with Mr. Benson, the Superintendent, and
very regular at all the services. So is he.</p>

<p>But for teaching children Miss Sallie wasn't
meant. She really wasn't. She never surely
knows the lesson herself, and it was such fun
asking her all sorts of questions just to see
her flounder round for answers that I used to
pretend I wanted to know a lot of things I
didn't. But I don't do that now. It was like
punching a lame cat to see it hop, and I
stopped.</p>

<p>She don't ask me anything, either. Never
has since the day Mr. Benson came in our
class and asked for a little review, and Martha
Cary made trouble, of course.</p>

<p>Miss Sallie was so red and excited by Mr.
Benson sitting there beside her that she didn't
know what she was doing. She didn't, or she
wouldn't have asked me questions, knowing I
never say the things I ought. But after a
minute she did ask me, fanning just as hard
as she could. It was in January.</p>

<p>"Now, Mary Cary, tell us something of the
people we have been studying about this winter,"
she said, "Mention something of Abraham,
Isaac, and Jacob, and Peter and Paul.
Who was Abraham?"</p>

<p>"Abraham was a coward," I said.</p>

<p>"A what?" And her voice was a little
shriek. "A what?"</p>

<p>"A coward. He was! He passed his wife
off for his sister, fearing trouble for himself,
and not thinking of consequences for her."</p>

<p>"That will do," she said, and she fanned
harder than ever, and looked real frightened at
Mr. Benson, who was blowing his nose. "Susie
Rice, who was Jacob?"</p>

<p>Susie didn't know. Nobody knew, so I spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Jacob was a rascal. He deceived his father
and stole from his brother. But he prospered
and repented, and died prominent."</p>

<p>Mr. Benson got up and said he believed his
nose was bleeding, and went out quick, and
since then Miss Sallie has never asked me a
single question. Not one.</p>

<p>Now I wonder what made Martha speak out
like that? Abraham and Jacob were good men
who did some bad things, but generally only
their goodness is mentioned. While you're living
it's apt to be the other way.</p>

<p>But I'm glad the bad is overlooked in time.
Maybe that is what God will do with everybody.
He'll wipe out all the wrongness and
meanness, and see through it to the good. I
hope that's the way it's going to be, for that's
my only chance.</p>

<p>Since Miss Sallie stopped asking me anything,
and I her, I have a lovely time in my
mind taking things off the other children and
putting them on the Orphans. There's Margaret
Evans. In the winter she's always blue
and frozen, and I'd give her that Mallory
child's velvet coat and gray muff and tippet,
and put Margaret's blue cape and calico dress
on her.</p>

<p>Poor little Margaret! She's so humble and
thankful she gets even less than the rest, it
looks like, though I suppose in clothes she has
the same allowance, and the difference, maybe,
is in herself.</p>

<p>Some people are born to be stepped on, and
of steppers there are always a-plenty.</p>

<p>After Sunday-school we walk to the church
we're going to, two by two, just alike and all
in blue. The minister always mentions us in
his prayers, except at St. John's, the prayer-book
not providing for Orphans in particular.</p>

<p>When church is over we march home and
have dinner, and after dinner we study the
lesson for next Sunday and practise hymns
until time for the afternoon service. That begins
at four, and some of the town ministers
preach or talk, generally preach, long and
wearisome.</p>

<p>The Episcopal minister gets through in a
hurry. We love to have him. He talks so
fast we don't half understand, and before we
know it he's got his hand up and we hear him
saying: "And now to the Father and to the
Son&mdash;." And the rest is mumbled, but we
know he's through and is glad of it, and so
are we.</p>

<p>The Presbyterian Sunday is the longest and
solemnest, and I always write a new story in
my mind when Dr. Moffett preaches. He is
very learned, and knows Hebrew and Latin and
Greek, but not much about little girls.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs Blamire; she tries to keep awake,
but she can't do it; and after the first five
minutes she puffs away just as regular as if
she were wound up. Once I shut my eyes and
tried to puff like her, but I forgot to be careful,
and did it so loud the girls came near getting
in trouble. Dr. Moffett is deaf, and didn't
hear. Miss Bray heard.</p>

<p>But the Baptist minister don't let you sleep
on his Sunday. He used to try to make the
girls come up and profess, but now he don't
ask even that. Just sit where you are and
hold up your hand, and when you join the
church&mdash;any church will answer&mdash;you are
saved. I don't understand it.</p>

<p>We all like the Methodist minister. I don't
think he knows many dead languages. He
don't have much time to study, being so busy
helping people; but he knows how to talk to
us children, and he always makes me wish I
wasn't so bad. He always does, and the Mary
part of me just rises right up on his Sunday,
and Martha is ashamed of herself. He believes
in getting better by the love way. So
do I.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine is going away next week to
stay two months. Going to her army brother's
first, and then to the California brother, who's
North somewhere. And from the time she told
me I've felt like Robinson Crusoe's daughter
would have felt, if he'd had one, and gone off
and left her on that desert island.</p>

<p>I don't know what we're going to do when
she goes away. I could shed gallons of tears,
only I don't like tears, and then, too, she might
see me. I want her to think I'm glad she's
going, for she needs a change. But, oh, the difference
her going will make!</p>

<p>I will be nothing but Martha. I know it.
Nothing but Martha until she comes back.
The Mary part of me is so sick at the thought
she hasn't any backbone, and Martha is showing
signs already.</p>

<p>And that shows I'm just nothing, for Miss
Katherine has taught us, without exactly telling,
how we can't do what we ought by wanting.
We've got to work. In plain words, its
watch and pray, and with me it's the watching
that's most important. If I'm not on the lookout,
and don't nab Martha right away, praying
don't have any effect. I'm a natural pray-er,
but on watching I'm poor.</p>

<p>I couldn't make any one understand what
Miss Katherine has done for us since she's been
here. Some words don't tell things. The
nursing when we're sick is only a part, and
though she's fixed up one of the rooms just
like a hospital-room, with everything so white
and clean and sweet in it that it's real joy to be
sick, we're not sick often.</p>

<p>It's the keeping us well that's kept her so
busy. She's explained so many things to us
we didn't know before, she's almost made
me like my body. I didn't use to. Not
a bit.</p>

<p>It's such a nuisance, and needs so much attention
to keep it going right. So often it was
freezing cold, or blazing hot, or hungry, and
had to be dressed in such ugly clothes that I
was ashamed of it. And if ever I could have
hung it up in the closet or put it away in a
bureau-drawer, I would have done it while I
went out and had a good time. But I couldn't
do it. I had to take it everywhere I went,
and until Miss Katherine came I had mighty
little use for it.</p>

<p>But since she's been here the girls are much
cleaner, and we don't mind so much not having
the things to eat that we like. That is, not
quite so much. But almost. When you're
downright hungry for the taste of things, it
don't satisfy to say to yourself "You don't
really need it. Be quiet." And being made
of flesh and blood, most of us would rather eat
the things we want to than the things we
ought to.</p>

<p>But the dining-room is much nicer. We have
flowers on the table, and the cooking is better,
though we still have prunes.</p>

<p>I loathe prunes.</p>

 knew when Miss Katherine left I'd
be nothing but Martha. That's what
I've been&mdash;Martha.</p>

<p>She hadn't been gone two days when
Mary gave up, and as prompt as possible
Martha invented trouble.</p>

<p>It was this way. In the summer we have
much more time than in the winter, and the
children kept coming to me asking me to make
up something, and all of a sudden a play came
in my mind. I just love acting. The play was
to be the marriage of Dr. Rudd and Miss Bray.</p>

<p>You see, Miss Bray is dead in love with Dr.
Rudd&mdash;really addled about him. And whenever
he comes to see any of the children who
are sick she is so solicitous and sweet and
smiley that we call her, to ourselves, Ipecac
Mollie. Other days, plain Mollie Cottontail. It
seemed to me if we could just think him into
marrying her, it would be the best work we'd
ever done, and I thought it was worth trying.</p>

<p>They say if you just think and think and
think about a thing you can make somebody
else think about it, too. And not liking Dr.
Rudd, we didn't mind thinking her on him,
and so we began. Every day we'd meet for
an hour and think together, and each one
promised to think single, and in between times
we got ready.</p>

<p>Becky Drake says love goes hard late in life,
and sometimes touches the brain. Maybe that
accounts for Miss Bray.</p>

<p>She is fifty-three years old, and all frazzled
out and done up with adjuncts. But Dr.
Rudd, being a man with not even usual sense,
and awful conceited, don't see what we see,
and swallows easy. Men are funny&mdash;funny as
some women.</p>

<p>I don't think he's ever thought of courting
Miss Bray. But she's thought of it, and for
once we truly tried to help her.</p>

<p>Well, we got ready, beginning two days after
Miss Katherine left, and the play came off
Friday night, the third of July. In consequence
of that play I have been in a retreat,
and on the Fourth of July I made a New-Year
resolution.</p>

<p>I resolved I would do those things I should not
do, and leave undone the things I should. I
would not disappoint Miss Bray. She looked for
things in me to worry her. She should find them.</p>

<p>Well, I was in that top-story summer-resort
for ten days. Put there for reflection. I reflected.
And on the difference between Miss
Katherine and Miss Bray.</p>

<p>But the play was a corker; it certainly was.
We chose Friday night because Miss Jones always
takes tea with her aunt that night, and
Miss Bray goes to choir practising. I wish
everybody could hear her sing! Gabriel ought
to engage her to wake the dead, only they'd
want to die again.</p>

<p>Dr. Rudd is in the choir, and she just lives
on having Friday nights to look forward to.</p>

<p>The ceremony took place in the basement-room
where we play in bad weather. It's
across from the dining-room, the kitchen being
between, and it's a right nice place to march
in, being long and narrow.</p>

<p>I was the preacher, and Prudence Arch and
Nita Polley, Emma Clark and Margaret Witherspoon
were the bridesmaids.</p>

<p>Lizzie Wyatt was the bride, and Katie Freeman,
who is the tallest girl in the house, though
only fourteen, was the groom.</p>

<p>Katie is so thin she would do as well for one
thing in this life as another, so we made her
Dr. Rudd.</p>

<p>We didn't have but two men. Miss Webb says
they're really not necessary at weddings, except
the groom and the minister. Nobody notices
them, and, besides, we couldn't get the pants.</p>

<p>I was an Episcopal minister, so I wouldn't
need any. Mrs. Blamire's raincoat was the
gown, and I cut up an old petticoat into strips,
and made bands to go down the front and
around my neck. Loulie Prentiss painted some
crosses and marks on them with gilt, so as to
make me look like a Bishop. I did. A little
cent one.</p>

<p>There wasn't any trouble about my costume,
because I could soap my hair and make it lie
flat, and put on the robe, and there I was.
But how to get a pair of pants for Katie Freeman
was a puzzle.</p>

<p>Nothing male lives in the Humane. Not
even a billy-goat. We couldn't borrow pants,
knowing it wouldn't be safe; and what to do
I couldn't guess.</p>

<p>Well, the day came, and, still wondering
where those pants were to come from, I went
out in the yard where a man was painting a
window-shutter that had blown off a back
window. Right before my eyes was the woodhouse
door wide open, and something said to
me:</p>

<p>"Walk in."</p>

<p>I walked in; and there in a corner on a woodpile
was a real nice pair of pants, and a collar
and cravat, and a coat and a tin lunch-bucket,
which had been eaten&mdash;the lunch had. And
when I saw those pants I knew Katie Freeman
was fixed.</p>

<p>They belonged to the man who was painting
the shutter.</p>

<p>It was an awful hot day, and he had taken
them off in the woodhouse and put on his overalls,
and when he wasn't looking I slipped out
with them, and went up to Miss Bray's room.
She was down-stairs talking to Miss Jones, and
I hid them under the mattress of her bed.</p>

<p>I knew when she found they were missing
she'd turn to me to know where they were.
No matter what went wrong, from the cat
having kittens or the chimney smoking, she
looked to me as the cause. And if there was
to be any searching, No. 4&mdash;I sleep in No. 4
when Miss Katherine is away&mdash;would be the
first thing searched. So I put them under her
bed.</p>

<p>I wish Miss Katherine could have seen that
man about six o'clock, when the time came for
him to go home. She would have laughed, too.
She couldn't have helped it.</p>

<p>He is young, and Bermuda Ray says he is in
love with Callie Payne, who lives just down
the street. He has to pass her house going
home, and I guess that's the reason he wore
his good clothes and took them off so carefully.
But whether that was it or not, he was the
rippenest, maddest man I ever saw in my life
when he went to put on his pants and there
were none to put.</p>

<p>I almost rolled off the porch up-stairs, where
I was watching. I never did know before how
much a man thinks of his pants.</p>

<p>He soon had Miss Bray and Miss Jones and a
lot of the girls out in the yard, and everybody
was talking at once; and then I heard him say:</p>

<p>"But I tell you, Miss Bray, I put 'em here,
right on this woodpile. And where are they?
You run this place, and you are responsible
for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not for pants." And Miss Bray's voice
was so shrill it sounded like a broken whistle.
"I'm responsible for no man's pants. When
a man can't take care of his pants, he shouldn't
have them. Besides, you shouldn't have left
yours in the woodhouse when working in a
Female Orphan Asylum." And she glared so
at him that the poor male thing withered, and
blushed real beautiful.</p>

<p>He's a pretty young man, and I felt sorry for
him when Miss Bray snapped so. I certainly did.</p>

<p>"My overalls are my working-pants," he
said, real meek-like, and his voice was trembling
so I thought he was going to cry. "It's very
strange that in a place like this a man's clothes
are not safe. I thought&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you had no business thinking. Next
time keep your pants on." And Miss Bray,
who's good on a bluff, pretended like she had
been truly injured, and the poor little painter
sat down.</p>

<p>Presently his face changed, as if a thought
had come into his mind from a long way off,
and he said, in another kind of voice:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Bray. I believe
I know who done it. It's a friend of mine who
tries to be funny every now and then, and
calls it joking. I'll choke his liver out of him!"
And he settled himself on the woodpile to wait
until dark before he went home.</p>

<p>If anybody thinks that wedding was slumpy,
they think wrong. It was thrilly. When the
bride and groom and the bridesmaids came in,
all the girls were standing in rows on either
side of the walk, making an aisle in between,
and they sang a wedding-song I had invented
from my heart.</p>

<p>It was to the Lohengrin tune, which is a little
wobbly for words, but they got them in
all right, keeping time with their hands. These
are the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>1<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Here comes the Bride,<br /></span>
<span>God save the Groom!<br /></span>
<span>And please don't let any chil-i-il-dren come,<br /></span>
<span>For they don't know<br /></span>
<span>How children feel,<br /></span>
<span>Nor do they know how with chil-dren to deal.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>2<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>She's still an old maid,<br /></span>
<span>Though she would not have been<br /></span>
<span>Could she have mar-ri-ed any kind of man.<br /></span>
<span>But she could not.<br /></span>
<span>So to the Humane<br /></span>
<span>She came, and caus-ed a good deal of pain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>3<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>But now she's here<br /></span>
<span>To be married, and go<br /></span>
<span>Away with her red-headed, red-bearded beau.<br /></span>
<span>Have mercy, Lord,<br /></span>
<span>And help him to bear<br /></span>
<span>What we've been doing this many a year!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And such singing! We'd been practising in the
back part of the yard, and humming in bed, so
as to get the words into the tune; but we hadn't
let out until that night. That night we let go.</p>

<p>There's nothing like singing from your heart,
and, though I was the minister and stood on a
box which was shaky, I sang, too. I led.</p>

<p>The bride didn't think it was modest to
hold up her head, and she was the only silent
one. But the bridegroom and bridesmaids sang,
and it sounded like the revivals at the Methodist
church. It was grand.</p>

<p>And that bride! She was Miss Bray. A
graven image of her couldn't have been more
like her.</p>

<p>She was stuffed in the right places, and her
hair was frizzed just like Miss Bray's. Frizzed
in front, and slick and tight in the back; and
her face was a purple pink, and powdered all
over, with a piece of dough just above her
mouth on the left side to correspond with
Miss Bray's mole.</p>

<p>And she held herself so like her, shoulders
back, and making that little nervous sniffle
with her nose, like Miss Bray makes when she's
excited, that once I had to wink at her to stop.</p>

<p>The groom didn't look like Dr. Rudd. But
she wore men's clothes, and that's the only
way you'd know some men were men, and
almost anything will do for a groom. Nobody
noticed him.</p>

<p>We were getting on just grand, and I was
marrying away, telling them what they must
do and what they mustn't. Particularly that
they mustn't get mad and leave each other,
for Yorkburg was very old-fashioned and didn't
like changes, and would rather stick to its mistakes
than go back on its word. And then I
turned to the bride.</p>

<p>"Miss Bray," I said, "have you told this
man you are marrying that you are two-faced
and underhand, and can't be trusted to tell the
truth? Have you told him that nobody loves
you, and that for years you have tried to pass
for a lamb, when you are an old sheep? And
does he know that though you're a good manager
on little and are not lazy, that your temper's
been ruined by economizing, and that at
times, if you were dead, there'd be no place
for you? Peter wouldn't pass you, and the
devil wouldn't stand you. And does he know
he's buying a pig in a bag, and that the best
wedding present he could give you would be
a set of new teeth? And will you promise to
stop pink powder and clean your finger-nails
every day? And&mdash;"</p>

<p>But I got no further, for something made me
look up, and there, standing in the door, was
the real Miss Bray.</p>

eautiful gloriousness! Miss Katherine
has come back!</p>

<p>What a different place some people
can make the same place!</p>

<p>Yesterday there wasn't an interesting
thing in Yorkburg. Nothing but
dust and shabby old houses and poky people
who knew nothing to talk about, and to-day&mdash;oh,
to-day it's dear! I love it!</p>

<p>You see, after that wedding everything went
wrong. The girls said it wasn't fair for me to
be punished so much more than the rest, and
they wanted to tell the Board about it; but
for once I agreed with Miss Bray.</p>

<p>"I did it. I made it up and fixed everything,
and you all just agreed," I said. "And if anybody
has to pay, I'm the one to do it." And
I paid all right. Paid to the full.
But it's over now, and I'm not going to think
about it any more. When a thing is over, that
should be the end of it, Miss Katherine says,
and with me what she says goes.</p>

<p>Miss Bray is away. If some of her relations
liked her well enough to have her stay a few
months with them, she could get leave of
absence; but she's never been known to stay
but four weeks. She's gone to visit her sister
somewhere in Fauquier County. Her sister's
husband always leaves home for his health
when she arrives, and Miss Bray says she thinks
it's so queer he has the same kind of spells
at the same time every year.</p>

<p>But now Miss Katherine's back, nothing matters.
Nothing!</p>

<p>Yesterday I was just a squirrel in a cage.
All day long I was saying: "Well, Squirrel, turn
your little wheel. That's all you can do; turn
your little wheel." And inside I was turning
as hard and fast as a sure-enough squirrel turns;
but outside I was just mechanical.</p>

<p>I wonder sometimes I don't blaze up right
before people's eyes. I'm so often on fire&mdash;that
is, my mind and heart are&mdash;that I think at times
my body will surely catch. Thus far it hasn't,
but if I don't go somewhere, see something, do
something different, it's apt to, and the doctors
won't have a name for the new kind of inflammation.</p>

<p>I'm going to die after a while, and I'm so
afraid I will do it before I travel some that
if I were a boy child I'd go anyhow. But I
can't go. That is, not yet.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine has been travelling for two
months up North. She's been with her brother
and his wife. The wife is sick, or she thinks
she is, which Miss Katherine says is a hard
disease to cure, and she's kept them moving
from place to place.</p>

<p>They wanted Miss Katherine to go to Europe
with them this fall, but she isn't going. She's
been twice, and says she don't want to go.
But I don't believe it's that. I believe it's
something else.</p>

<p>But sufficient unto the day is the happiness
thereof! I'm going to enjoy her staying, and
already everything seems different.</p>

<p>You see, Miss Katherine lives here just for
love, and when you do things for love you do
them differently from the way you do them
for money.</p>

<p>We are just Charity children, some not knowing
who they are, I being one of that kind; but
she never treats us as if she thinks of that. If
we were relations she liked, she couldn't be
kinder or nicer, and when a child is in trouble
Miss Katherine is the one that's gone to at
once.</p>

<p>She is never too tired or too busy to listen,
but she's awful firm; and there's no nonsense
or sullenness or shamming where she is. She
can see through the insides of your soul, up
to the top and down to the tip, and in front
of her eyes you are just your plain self. Only
that, and nothing more. They are gray, her
eyes are, with a dark rim around the gray part;
and she has the longest black lashes I ever saw.
Her hair is black, too, like an Eastern Princess
and in the morning when she puts her cap on
and her nurse's white dress, which she wears
when on duty, I call her to myself, "My Lady
of the Lovely Heart," and I could kneel down
and say my prayers to her.</p>

<p>I don't, though, for she would tell me pretty
quick to get up. She doesn't like things like
that, and, of course, it would look queer.</p>

<p>But I don't know anybody who isn't queer
about something. Either stupid queer, or silly
queer, or smart queer, or beautiful queer, or religious
queer, or selfish queer, or some other kind.</p>

<p>Miss Bray is the Queen of Queers.</p>

<p>But Miss Katherine is queer, too. If she wasn't,
she wouldn't stay at this Orphan Asylum, just
to help us children, and doing it as cheerfully
as if she were happier here than she would be
anywhere else. If her staying isn't queerness,
beautiful queerness, what is it?</p>

<p>I don't understand it, and I don't believe I
ever will understand how any one who can get
ice-cream will take prunes.</p>

<p>But Miss Katherine has got a way of seeing
the funny side of things, and sometimes I
can't tell whether she minds prunes and pruny
things or not.</p>

<p>I'm sure she does, but she says, when you can't
change a thing, don't let it change you, and that
an inward disposition is hard on other people.</p>

<p>I don't know what that means, but I think
it's the same as saying there's no use in always
chewing the rag. Martha is right much inclined
to be a chewer.</p>

<p>Miss Webb is, too. She is Miss Katherine's
best friend, and I just love to hear her talk.</p>

<p>She always comes once a week, often twice,
to spend the evening at the Asylum with Miss
Katherine, and sometimes when they think I'm
asleep, I'm not. I'd be a nuisance if I kept popping
up and saying, "I'm not asleep, speak low."
So when I can't, really can't, sleep, though I do
try, I hear them talking, and the things Miss
Webb says are a great relief to my feelings.</p>

<p>She doesn't come to supper, orphan-asylum
suppers being refreshments to stay from, not
come to, but nearly always they make something
on a chafing-dish. Something that's good,
painful good.</p>

<p>Miss Webb says Miss Katherine's stomach
has some rights, which is true; and when they
begin to cook, I just sleep away, breathing
regular and easy, so they won't know I am
awake, for fear they might think I am not
asleep on purpose.</p>

<p>But I have to hold on to the bed and stuff
my ears and nose so as not to hear and smell,
for I am that hungry I could eat horse if it had
Worcestershire sauce on it. And that is what
they put in their things, which shows that in
eating, even, Miss Katherine preaches sense and
practises taste.</p>

<p>Miss Webb just laughs at theories, and brings
all sorts of good things with her. She says
doctors have wronged more stomachs than
they've ever righted by all this dieting business,
and, while there's sense in some of it, there's more
nonsense; and as for her, she don't believe in it.
I don't know anything about it; but I don't,
either.</p>

<p>They always save me some of whatever they
make, which I get the next day. But if I could
rise out of bed and eat as much as I want out
of that chafing-dish, there would be a funeral
Miss Bray would like to attend. The corpse
would be Mary Cary, died Martha.</p>

<p>There is a screen at the foot of my bed, put
there so the light won't bother me and so I
won't be seen. And, thinking I am asleep,
Miss Katherine and Miss Webb talk on as if I
were dead; and it's very interesting the things
they talk about.</p>

<p>Of course, Miss Webb came over last night,
and, after talking about two hours, she said:
"Oh, I forgot to tell you. Lizzie Lane is going
to marry Bob Rogers, and right away. I don't
suppose you've heard."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have; Lizzie wrote me." And Miss
Katherine took the hair-pins out of her hair
and let it fall down her back. "What made
her change her mind? What is she marrying
him for?"</p>

<p>"How do I know?" And Miss Webb tasted
the chocolate to see if it was sweet enough.</p>

<p>"How does anybody know what a man is
married for? In most cases you can't risk a
guess. Lizzie is a woman, therefore 'hath reason
or unreason for her act.'"</p>

<p>"How did it happen? What made her change
her mind?" and Miss Katherine threw her hair-pins
on the bureau and stooped down to get her
slippers. "How does Lizzie explain it?"</p>

<p>"She says she was so sleepy she doesn't remember
whether she said yes or no. But Bob
remembers, and the wedding is to be week after
next. He's courted her three times a year for
seven years; but since he's been living North
he hasn't even written to her, and she didn't
know he was in town until he came up that
night to see her.</p>

<p>"He stayed until after one o'clock, and didn't
mention marriage. But as he got up to go he
told her his house was going to send him on a
six months' trip to Japan. If she would marry
him and go, say so. If not, say that, too, but
for the last time. Lizzie said she'd go."</p>

<p>Miss Katherine fastened her kimono, put her
feet up on the chair in front of her, and clasped
her hands behind her head.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder at the unhappy marriages,"
she said. "The queer part is there aren't more
of them. Why did Bob wait eight years to talk
to Lizzie like this? Why is it a man has so
little understanding of a woman?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because he's a Man. The Lord made
him, and there must be some reason for him;
but even the Lord must sometimes get worn
out at his dumbness. However&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped, for the chocolate was boiling
over; then she began to sing:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"Before marriage, men love most.<br /></span>
<span>After marriage, women best.<br /></span>
<span>Marriage many changes makes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Heart is happy or heart breaks."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And she sang it so many times that I went
to sleep and dreamed the dream I love most.</p>

<p>I see hundreds and hundreds of little creatures
(they are the Mary part of little children),
and they are afraid and shivering and standing
about, not knowing where to go or what to
do. And then Miss Katherine is in the midst
of them, smiling and beckoning, and they follow
and follow, and wings come out. Just tiny
ones at first, and then larger and larger, and
presently they fly all around her, and she points
the way, smiling and cheering.</p>

<p>And then they rise higher and higher, and off
they go, and she is alone. Tired out but glad,
because she taught them how to use their wings.</p>

his is Sunday, and we have done all
the usual Sunday things. There won't
be another for seven days. For that
we give thanks in our hearts, but not
out loud.</p>

<p>This was Presbyterian Sunday. Miss
Bray is a Presbyterian.</p>

<p>It is a solemn thing to be a Presbyterian,
and easy for the mind, too. Everything is
fixed, and there is no unfixing. You are saved
or you are not saved, and you will never know
which it is until after you are dead and find out.
Miss Bray believes she is saved, and she takes
liberties. She also thinks everything is as God
ordered it, and she believes God ordered poor
Mrs. Craddock to die&mdash;that is, took her away.
I don't. I think it was that last baby.</p>

<p>She had had twelve, and the thirteenth just
wore her out at the thought. There being nobody
to do anything for her, she got up and
cooked breakfast in her stocking feet when the
baby was only a week old, and that night she
had the influenza, and the next pneumonia.
On the sixth day she was dead, and so was the
baby. They forgot to feed it.</p>

<p>I don't believe God ever took any mothers
away intentional. He never would have made
them so necessary if He had meant to take them
away when they were most needed. When
they go I believe He is sorry.</p>

<p>I don't know how to explain it. Nobody
does, though a lot try. But I know He sees it
bigger than we do, and maybe He is working at
something that isn't finished yet.</p>

<p>Minnie Peters is real sick. Miss Katherine
has put her in the hospital-room, and is staying
in there with her.</p>

<p>I am all alone by myself to-night. I don't
like aloneness at night. It makes you pay too
much attention to your feelings, which Miss
Katherine says is the cause of more trouble in
this world than all other diseases put together.</p>

<p>She says, too, that what we feel about a thing
is very often different from the way other people
feel about it. And when you don't agree
with people, the only thing you can be sure
about is that they don't agree with you.
I believe that's true. Not being by nature
much of an agree-er, and having feelings I hope
others don't, I would be a walking argument if
Miss Katherine hadn't stopped me and explained
some things I didn't realize before.</p>

<p>Last night, being by myself, and not being
able to go to sleep, I wrote a piece of poetry.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine says it's hard to forgive people
who think they write poetry, so I won't show
her this. But it does relieve you to write down
a lot of woozy nothing that is somehow like
you feel. This is the poem&mdash;I mean the verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>1<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Out upon life's ocean vast,<br /></span>
<span>With the current drifting fast,<br /></span>
<span>I am sailing. Oh, alas,<br /></span>
<span>'Tis a lonely feeling!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>2<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Why was such a trip e'er started<br /></span>
<span>On a pathway all uncharted?<br /></span>
<span>Why from loved ones was I parted?<br /></span>
<span>Who will answer? Who?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>3<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>None will answer. So I'll see<br /></span>
<span>What there is on this journey (journee)<br /></span>
<span>That will bring good-luck to me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I'll look out and see!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I hope Minnie isn't going to be sick long.
She is the first girl to be really ill since Miss
Katherine came. It makes you feel so queer
in the throat to know somebody is truly sick.</p>

<p>A lot of the girls have been sick a little with
colds and small and unserious diseases in the
past year. But Miss Katherine says it's her
business to keep us well, not just get us well
after we're sick, and she's certainly done it.
We've been weller than we ever were in our
lives, and no medicine taken. Just plain common-sense
regulations.</p>

<p>I wonder what's the matter with Minnie?
The doctor hasn't said, but Miss Katherine is
uneasy, and she won't let anybody come in
the room. She hasn't been out herself since
yesterday.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>My, but we've had a time lately!</p>

<p>We've been fumigated and sterilized and
fertilized so much that we are better prepared
for the happy-land than we ever were before.
But the danger of anybody going to it right
away is over.</p>

<p>Minnie Peters has had scarlet fever, and the
commotion made her real famous.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine knew it from the first, but
Dr. Rudd wouldn't believe it until he had to,
and Yorkburg got so excited it hasn't talked
of anything else for weeks.</p>

<p>Minnie was awful ill. Two days and two
nights they didn't think she would live, and
for three weeks Miss Katherine didn't leave the
room. If it hadn't been for her Minnie would
be dead.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine's room has been closed since
they first found out it was really scarlet fever
Minnie had, and I have been in No. 4 again.
She is going away to spend a week with Miss
Webb. Going to-morrow.</p>

<p>I am so glad she is going. All of us are
glad, for she has had to do something which
shows whether you are a Christ-kind Christian
or the usual kind, and she is tired out. She
won't admit it, though, and laughs and kisses
her hand over the banister, which is all the
closer we have seen her yet.</p>

<p>Miss Bray was scared to death. She didn't
offer to share the nursing, but she made excuses
a-plenty for not doing it. Miss Bray is a
church Christian. You couldn't make her miss
going to church. She thinks she'd have bad
luck if she did.</p>

<h2>MARY CARY'S BUSINESS</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/t.png" alt="T" title="T" /></div><p>
his is a busy time of the year, and
things are moving. I'm in business.
The Apple and Entertainment business.</p>

<p>The reason I went in business was
to make money, and the money was
to buy Christmas presents with.</p>

<p>I didn't have a cent. Not one. Christmas
was coming. Money wasn't. And what's the
use of Christmas if you can't give something
to somebody?</p>

<p>Religion is the only thing I know of that you
can get without money and without price, and
even that you can't keep without both. Not
being suitable to the season, I couldn't give that
away, even if I had it to spare, and wondering
what to do almost made me sick.</p>

<p>I thought and thought until my brain curdled.
I looked over everything I had to see if there
was a thing I could sell. There wasn't. I
couldn't tell Miss Katherine, knowing she'd fix
up some way to give me some and pretend I
was earning it; and then, one day, when she
was out, I locked myself in her room, and
Martha gave Mary such a spanking talk that
Mary moved.</p>

<p>Everything Martha had suggested before,
Mary had some excuse for not doing. Mary is
lazy at times, and, as for pride, she's full of it.
Martha generally gives the trouble, but Mary
needs plain truth every now and then, and that
day she got it. When the talk was over, there
was a plan settled on, and the plan was this.</p>

<p>Each day in December we have an apple for
dinner. Mr. Riley sends us several barrels
every winter, and, as they won't keep, we have
one apiece until they're gone.</p>

<p>We don't have to eat them at the table, and
when Martha told Mary you could do anything
you wanted if you wanted to hard
enough&mdash;except raise the dead, of course&mdash;the
idea came that I could sell my apple. And
right away came the thought of the boy I could
sell it to. John Maxwell is his name.</p>

<p>He goes to our Sunday-school and is fifteen,
and croaks like a bull-frog. Ugly? Pug-dog
ugly; but he's awful nice, and for a boy has
real much sense.</p>

<p>His father owns the shoe-factory, and has
plenty of money. I know, for he told me he
had five cents every day to get something for
lunch, and fifty cents a week to do anything
he wants with. His mother gives it to him.</p>

<p>Well, the next Sunday he came over to talk,
like he always does after Sunday-school is out,
and I said, real quick, Mary giving signs of
silliness:</p>

<p>"I'm in business. Did you know it?"</p>

<p>"No," he said. "What kind? Want a
partner?"</p>

<p>"I don't. I want customers. I'm in the
Apple business. I have an apple every day.
It's for sale. Want to buy it?"</p>

<p>"What's the price?" Then he laughed.
"I'm from New Jersey. What's it worth?"</p>

<p>"It's worth a cent. As you're from New
Jersey, I charge you two. Take it?"</p>

<p>"I do." And he started to hand the money
out.</p>

<p>But I told him I didn't want pay in advance.
And then we talked over how the apple could
be put where he could get it, and the money
where I could. We decided on a certain hole
in the Asylum fence John knew about, and
every evening that week I put my apple there
and found his two pennies. On Saturday night
I had fourteen cents. Wasn't that grand?
Fourteen cents!</p>

<p>But the next Sunday there came near being
trouble. Roper Gordon&mdash;he's John Maxwell's
cousin&mdash;had heard about the apple selling.
He told me I wasn't charging enough, and
that he'd pay three cents for it.</p>

<p>"I'll be dogged if you will," said John. "I'm
cornering that apple, and I'll meet you. I'll
give four."</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "I'm in business to
make money. I'm not charging for worth, but
for want. The one who wants it most will
pay most. It can go at four."</p>

<p>"No, it can't!" said Roper. His father is
rich, too. He's the Vice-President of the
Factory, and Roper puts on lots of airs. He
thinks money can do anything.</p>

<p>"I'll give five. Apples in small lots come
high, and selected ones higher. John is a close
buyer, and isn't toting square."</p>

<p>"That's a lie!" said John, and he lit out with
his right arm and gave Roper such a blow that
my heart popped right out on my tongue and
sat there. Scared? I was weak as a dead
cat.</p>

<p>But I grabbed John and pulled him behind
me before Roper could hit back, and then in
some way they got outside, and I heard afterward
John beat Roper to a jelly.</p>

<p>I don't blame him. If any one were to say
I wasn't square, I'd fight, too.</p>

<p>When you don't fight, it's because what is
said is true, and you're afraid it will be found
out. And a coward. Good Lord!</p>

<p>Anyhow, after that I got five cents a day
for my apple. John put six cents in, raising
Roper, he said, but I wouldn't keep but five.</p>

<p>"I can't," I said. "I hate my conscience,
for even in business it pokes itself in. But
five cents is all I can take."</p>

<p>"Which shows you're new in business, or
you'd take the other fellow's skin if he had to
have what you've got. And I'm bound to have
that apple. Bound to!" And he dug the toe
of his shoe so deep in the dirt he could have
put his foot in. We were down at the fence,
where I went to tell him he mustn't leave but
five cents any more.</p>

<p>The Apple business was much easier than
the Entertainment business; but I enjoyed
both. Making money is exciting. I guess
that's why men love to make it.</p>

<p>I made in all $2.34. One dollar and fifty
cents on entertaining, and eighty-four cents
on apples.</p>

<p>The entertaining was this way. Mrs. Dick
Moon is twin to the lady who lived in a shoe.
Her house isn't far from the Asylum, and I like
her real much; but she isn't good on management.
Everything on the place just runs over
everything else, and nothing is ever ready on
time.</p>

<p>She has money&mdash;that is, her husband has,
which Miss Katherine says isn't always the
same thing. And she has servants and a graphophone
and a pianola, but she doesn't really
seem to have anything but children, and they
are everywhere.</p>

<p>They are the sprawly kind that lie on their
stomachs and kick their heels, and get under
your feet and on your back. And their mouths
always have molasses or sugar in the corners,
and their noses have colds, and their hands are
that sticky they leave a print on everything
they touch.</p>

<p>But they aren't mean-bad, just bad because
they don't know what to do, and they beg me
to stay and play with them when Miss Jones
sends me over with a message. Sometimes I
do, and the day Martha gave Mary such a
rasping about making money, another thought
came besides the apples, and I went that afternoon
to see Mrs. Moon.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Moon," I said, "the children have
colds and can't go out. If Miss Bray will let
me, would you like me to come over and entertain
them during our play-hour? It's from
half-past four to half-past five. I'll come every
day from now until Christmas, and I charge
twenty-five cents a week for it."</p>

<p>I knew my face was rambler red. I hated
to mention money, but I hated worse not to
have any to buy Miss Katherine a present
with. If she thought twenty-five cents a
week too high she could say so. But she
didn't.</p>

<p>"Mercy, Mary Cary!" she said, "do you
mean it? Would I like you to come? Would I?
I wish I could buy you!" And she threw her
arms around me and kissed me so funny I
thought she was going to cry.</p>

<p>"Of course I want you," she went on, after
wiping her nose. She had a cold, too. "You
can manage the children better than I, and if
you knew what one quiet hour a day meant to
the mother of seven, all under twelve, you'd
charge more than you're doing. I'll see Miss
Bray to-morrow."</p>

<p>She saw, and Miss Bray let me come.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moon is a member of the Board, and
Mr. Moon is rich. Miss Bray never sleeps in
waking time.</p>

<p>Well, when Mrs. Moon paid me for the first
week, she gave me fifty cents instead of twenty-five,
and I wouldn't take it.</p>

<p>"But you've earned it," she said, putting it
back in my hand, and giving it a little pat&mdash;a
little love pat. "You didn't say you were
coming on Sundays, and you came. Sunday is
the worst day of all. I nearly go crazy on Sunday.
No, child, don't think you're getting too
much. One doctor's visit would be two dollars,
and the prescription forty cents, anyhow. The
children would be on the bed, and my head
splitting, and Mammy as much good in keeping
them quiet as a cackling hen. I feel like
I'm cheating in only paying fifty cents. Each
nap was worth that. I wish I could engage
you by the year!" And she gave me such a
squeeze I almost lost my breath.</p>

<p>But they are funny, those Moon children.
Sarah Sue is the oldest, and nobody ever knows
what Sarah Sue is going to say.</p>

<p>Yesterday I made them tell me what they
were going to buy for their mother's and
father's Christmas presents, and the things
they said were queer. As queer as the presents
some grown people give each other.</p>

<p>"I'm going to give father a set of tools,"
said Bobbie. "I saw 'em in Mr. Blakey's window,
and they'll cut all right. They cost
eighty-five cents."</p>

<p>"What are you going to give your father tools
for?" I asked. "He's not a boy."</p>

<p>"But I am." And Bobbie jumped over a
chair on Billy's back. "You said yourself you
ought always to give a person a thing you'd
like to have, and I'd like those tools. They're
the bulliest set in Yorkburg. I'm going to give
mother a little yellow duck. That's at Mr.
Blakey's, too."</p>

<p>"It don't cost but five cents," said Sarah
Sue, and she looked at Bobbie as if he were
not even the dust of the earth. Then she
handed me her list.</p>

<p>"But, Sarah Sue," I said, after I'd read it,
"you've got seventy-five cents down here for
your mother and only fifty for your father.
Do you think it's right to make a difference?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do." And Sarah Sue's big brown
eyes were as serious as if 'twere funeral flowers
she was selecting. "You see, it's this way.
I love them both seventy-five cents' worth,
but I don't think I ought to give them the
same. Father is just my father by marriage,
but Mother's my mother by bornation. I think
mothers ought always to have the most."</p>

<p>I think so, too.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/c.png" alt="C" title="C" /></div><p>
hristmas is over. I feel like the
parlor grate when the fire has gone
out.</p>

<p>But it was a grand Christmas, the
grandest we've ever known. It came
on Christmas Day. From the time
we got up until we went to bed we were so
happy we forgot we were Charity children; and
no matter whatever happens, we've got one
beautiful time to look back on.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine says a beautiful memory is
a possession no one can take from you, and it's
one of the best possessions you can have. I
think so, too. She's made all my memories.
All. I mean the precious ones.</p>

<p>Everybody in this Orphan Asylum had a
present from somebody outside. Even me,
who might as well be that man in the Bible,
Melchesey something, who didn't have beginning
or end, or any relations.</p>

<p>I had fourteen from outside. Some I hid,
because I didn't want the girls to know, several
not getting more than one, and hardly any
more than three or four.</p>

<p>Those who had the heart to give them didn't
have the money, and those who had the money
didn't have the heart. Being so busy with their
own they forgot to remember, and if it hadn't
been for Miss Katherine and her friends this
last Christmas would have been like all others.</p>

<p>Her Army brother's wife sent a box full of
all sorts of pretty Indian things, she being in
the wild West near the Indians who made them.
And she sent ten dolls, all dressed, for the ten
youngest girls.</p>

<p>She is awful busy, having three children and
not much money; but Miss Katherine says busy
people make time, and those who have most to
do, do more still.</p>

<p>She sent me the darlingest little bedroom
slippers with fur all around the top. And in
them she put a little note that made me cry
and cry and cry, it was so dear and mothery.
I don't know what made me cry, but I couldn't
help it. I couldn't.</p>

<p>She doesn't know me except from what Miss
Katherine writes, and I wonder why she wrote
that note. But everybody is good to me&mdash;that
is, nearly everybody.</p>

<p>It certainly makes a difference in your backbone
when people are kind and when they are
not. I don't believe unkindness and misfortune
and suffering will ever make me good.
If anybody is mean to me, I'm stifferer than a
lamp-post, and you couldn't make me cry.
But when any one is good to me, I haven't a
bit of firmness, and am no better than a caterpillar.</p>

<p>I got thirty-one presents this year. Thirty-one!
I didn't know I had so many friends in
Yorkburg, and my heart was so bursting with
surprise and gratitude it just ached. Ached
happy.</p>

<p>We are not often allowed to make regular
visits, but I have lots of little talks informal
on errands, or messages, or passing; and as I
know almost everybody by sight, I have a right
large speaking acquaintance. With some people,
Miss Katherine says, that's the safest kind
to have.</p>

<p>You see, Yorkburg is a very small place.
Just three long streets and some short ones
going across. Scratching up everything, it
hasn't got three thousand people in it. A lot
of them are colored.</p>

<p>But it's very old and historic. Awful old;
so is everything in it. As for its blue blood,
Mrs. Hunt says there's more in Yorkburg than
any place of its size in America.</p>

<p>Most of the strangers who come here, though,
seem to prefer to pass on rather than stop, and
Miss Webb thinks it's on account of the blood.
A little red mixed in might wake Yorkburg up,
she says, and that's what it needs&mdash;to know
the war is over and the change has come to
stay.</p>

<p>But I love Yorkburg, and most of the people
are dear. Some queer. Old Mrs. Peet is.
Her husband has been dead forty years, but
she still keeps his hat on the rack for protection,
and whenever any one goes to see her
after dark she always calls him, as if he were
upstairs.</p>

<p>She lives by herself and is over seventy, and
she's pretended so long that he's living that
they say she really believes he is. She almost
makes you believe it, too.</p>

<p>Miss Bray sent me there one night. She
wanted some cherry-bounce for Eliza Green,
who had an awful pain, and after I'd knocked,
I'd have run if I'd dared.</p>

<p>In the hall I could hear Mrs. Peet pounding
on the floor with her stick. Then her little
piping voice:</p>

<p>"Mr. Peet, Mr. Peet, you'd better come down!
There's some one at the door! You'd better
come down, Mr. Peet!"</p>

<p>"It's just Mary Cary!" I called. "Miss Bray
sent me, Mrs. Peet. She wants some cherry-bounce."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right, Mr. Peet. You needn't bother
to come down. It's just little Mary Cary."
And she opened the door a tiny crack and
peeped through.</p>

<p>"Mr. Peet isn't very well to-night," she said.
"He's taken fresh cold. But you can come in."</p>

<p>I came; but I didn't want to. And if Mr.
Peet had come down those steps and shaken
hands I wouldn't have been surprised. It's
certainly strange how something you know
isn't true seems true; and Mr. Peet, dead
forty years, seemed awful alive that night.
Every minute I thought he'd walk in.</p>

<p>She likes you to think he's living at night.
Every day she goes to his grave, which is in
the churchyard right next to where she lives;
but at night he comes back to life to her.
She's so lonely, I think it's beautiful that he
comes.</p>

<p>I make out like I think he comes, too, and
I always send him my love, and ask how his
rheumatism is. I tell you, Martha don't dare
smile when I do it. She don't even want to.</p>

<p>And, don't you know, old Mrs. Peet sent me
a Christmas present, too. A pair of mittens.
She knit them herself. It was awful nice of
her.</p>

<p>I don't know how big the check was that
Miss Katherine's billionaire brother sent her
to spend on the children's Christmas, but it
must have been a corker. The things she
bought with it cost money, and the change it
made in the Asylum was Cinderellary. It
was.</p>

<p>She bought a carpet for the parlor, and some
curtains for the windows, and a bookcase of
books.</p>

<p>For the dining-room she bought six new
tables and sixty chairs. They were plain, but
to sit at a table with only ten at it instead of
forty, as I'd been sitting for many years, was
to have a proud sensation in your stomach.
Mine got so gay I couldn't eat at the first meal.</p>

<p>To have a chair all to yourself, after sitting
on benches so old they were worn on both
edges, was to feel like the Queen of Sheba, and
I felt like her. I could have danced up and
down the table, but instead I said grace over
and over inside. I had something to say it
for. All of us did.</p>

<p>Besides a present, each of us had a new
dress. It was made of worsted&mdash;real worsted,
not calico; and that morning after breakfast,
and after everything had been cleaned up, we
put on our new dresses and came down in the
parlor.</p>

<p>And such a fire as there was in it!</p>

<p>It sputtered and flamed, and danced and
blazed, and crackled and roared. Oh, it knew
it was Christmas, that fire did, and the mistletoe
and holly and running cedar knew it, too!</p>

<p>At first, though, the children felt so stiff
and funny in their new-shaped dresses made
like other children's that they weren't natural,
so I pretended we were having a soir&eacute;e, and I
went round and shook hands with every one.</p>

<p>They got to laughing so at the names I gave
them&mdash;names that fit some, and didn't touch
others by a thousand years&mdash;that the stiffness
went. And if in all Yorkburg there was a
cheerfuller room or a happier lot of children
that Christmas Day than we were, we didn't
hear of it. I don't believe there was, either.</p>

<p>The reason we enjoyed this Christmas so was
because it was on Christmas Day.</p>

<p>Our celebrations had always been after
Christmas, and Christmas after Christmas is like
cold buckwheat cakes and no syrup. Like an
orange with the juice all gone.</p>

<p>As for the tree, it was a spanker. We were
dazed dumb for a minute when the parlor doors
leading into the sewing-room were opened.
But never being able to stay dumb long, I
commenced to clap. Then everybody clapped.
Clapped so hard half the candles went out.</p>

<p>There wasn't a soul on the place that didn't
get a present. This tree was Miss Katherine's,
not the Board's, and the presents bought with
the brother's money were things we could keep.
Not things to put away and pass on to somebody
else next year. I almost had a fit when
I found I had roller-skates and a set of books
too. Think of it! Roller-skates and books!
The rich brother sent those himself, and I'm
still wondering why.</p>

<p>This was Miss Katherine's second Christmas
with us, but the first she had managed herself.
Last Christmas she had been at the Asylum
such a short time she kept quiet, and just saw
how things were done. And not done. But
this year she asked if she could provide the
entertainment, and the difference in these last
two Christmases was like the difference in the
way things are done from love and duty.</p>

<p>And oh! love is so much the best!</p>

<p>I do believe I was the happiest child in all
the world that day, and I didn't come out of
that cloud of glory until night. Mrs. Christopher
Pryor took me out.</p>

<p>She had come over with some of the Board
ladies to see the tree and things, and as she
was going home I heard her say:</p>

<p>"I don't approve of all this. Not at all.
Not at all. These children have had a more
elaborate Christmas than mine. They've had
as good a dinner, a handsomer tree, and as
many presents as some well-off people. It's
all nonsense, putting notions in their heads
when they're as poor as poverty itself and have
their living to make. I don't approve of it.
Not at all."</p>

<p>She bristled so stiff and shook her head so
vigorous that the little jet ornaments on her
bonnet just tinkled like bells, and one fell off.</p>

<p>Mrs. Christopher Pryor is one of the people
who would like to tell the Lord how to run
this earth. She could run it. That He lets
the rain fall and sun shine on everybody alike
is a thing she don't approve of either. As
for poor people, she thinks they ought to be
thankful for breath, and not expect more
than enough to keep it from going out for
good.</p>

<p>She's very decided in her views, and never
keeps them to herself. It's the one thing she
gives away. Everything else she holds on to
with such a grip that it keeps her upper lip so
pressed down on her under lip that she breathes
through her nose most of the time.</p>

<p>She's a very curious shape. Being stout, she
has to hold her head up to keep her chin off
her fatness; and she goes in so at the waist,
coming out top and bottom, that you would
think something in her would get jammed out
of place. You really would.</p>

<p>There are seven daughters. No sons. The
boys call their place Hen-House. There is a
husband, but nobody seems to notice him; and
when with his wife, he always walks behind.</p>

<p>Miss Webb says she's sorry for a man whose
wife is too active in the church. Mrs. Pryor is.
She leads all the responses; and as for the
chants, she takes them right out of the choir's
mouth and soars off with them.</p>

<p>I never could bear her; and when I heard her
say those words to Mrs. Marsden, I came right
down to earth and was Martha Cary in a minute.
I'd been Mary all day, and, like a splash
in a mud-puddle, she made me Martha; and I
heard myself say:</p>

<p>"No, Mrs. Pryor, we know you don't approve.
You never yet have let a child here
forget she was a Charity child, and only people
who make others happy will approve."</p>

<p>Then I walked away as quiet as a Nun's
daughter. But I was burning hot all the same,
and so surprised at the way Martha spoke, so
serious and unlike the way she usually speaks
when mad, that I had to go on the back porch
and make snowballs and throw hard at something
before I was all right again.</p>

<p>But I wouldn't let it ruin my beautiful day.
I wouldn't.</p>

<p>That night, when I went to bed, I was so
tired out with happiness I couldn't half say
my prayers. But I knew God understood.
He let the Christ-child be born poor and lowly,
so He could understand about Charity children,
and everybody else who goes wrong because
they don't know how to go right. So I just
thanked Him, and thanked Him in my heart.</p>

<p>And when Miss Katherine kissed me good-night
and tucked me in bed, she said I'd made
her have a beautiful Christmas. That I'd
helped everybody and kept things from dragging,
because I had enjoyed it so myself, and
been so enthusiastic, and she was so glad I
was born that way.</p>

<p>I thought she was making fun, it was so
ridiculous, thanking me, little Mary Cary, who
hadn't done a thing but be glad and seen that
nobody was forgot.</p>

<p>But she wasn't making fun, and I went off
to sleep and dreamed I was in a place called
the Love-Land, where everybody did everything
just for love. Which shows it was a dreamland,
for on earth there're Brays and Pryors,
and people too busy to be kind. And in that
Love-Land everything was done the other way,
just backward from our way, and yourself came
second instead of first.</p>

<h2>THE REAGAN BALL</h2>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i.png" alt="I" title="I" /></div><p>
t is snowing fast and furious to-day.
It's grand to watch it. I love miracles,
and it's a miracle to see an ugly
place turn into a palace of marble
and silver with diamond decorations.
That's what the Asylum is to-day.
I certainly would like to have seen the
Reagan ball. Miss Webb says it was the best
show ever given in Yorkburg, and she enjoyed
it, being particular fond of freaks.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine didn't want to go, but Miss
Webb made her. For weeks that Reagan ball
had been talked about, and Yorkburg knew
things about it that had never been known
about parties before, money not often being
mentioned here.</p>

<p>Everybody knew what this ball was going
to cost. Knew the supper was coming from
New York, with white waiters and kid gloves.
And what Mrs. Reagan and her daughters were
going to wear. That their dresses had been
made in Europe, and that Mrs. Hamner hadn't
been invited, and that more money was coming
to Yorkburg in the shape of one man than had
ever been in it altogether before.</p>

<p>If I just could have put myself invisible on
a picture-frame and looked down on that fleeting
show I would have done it. But not being
able to work that miracle, I just heard what
was going round, and it was very interesting,
the things I heard.</p>

<p>Miss Webb and Miss Katherine and I think
just alike about Mrs. Reagan. I know, for I
heard them talking one night just before the
ball.</p>

<p>"But why in the name of Heaven should I go
if I don't want to?" said Miss Katherine, and
she put her feet on the fender and lay back in
her big rose-covered chair. "I don't like her,
or her family, the English she speaks, or the
books she reads. Why, then, should I go to
her parties? I'm not going!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you are." And Miss Webb put some
more coal on the fire and made it blaze. "Knowledge
of life requires a knowledge of humanity
In all its subdivisions. Mrs. Reagan is a new
sub. As a curio, she's worth the price. You
couldn't keep me from her show."</p>

<p>"But she's such a snob. When a woman does
not know her grandfather's first name on her
mother's side and talks of people not being in
her set, Christian charity does not require you
to visit her. I agree with Mrs. Rodman. People
like that ought to be let alone."</p>

<p>"But Mrs. Rodman isn't going to let them
alone. Not for a minute. The only thing that
goes on among them that she doesn't know is
what she can't find out. She met me this
morning, and asked me if I'd heard how many
people had gotten here, and when I said no,
she made me come in Miss Patty's store, and
told me all she'd been able to discover.</p>

<p>"'There are eighteen guests already,' she
said, 'and nearly all have rooms to themselves.
They tell me it's the fashion now for
husbands and wives not to see each other until
breakfast, and not then if the wife wants hers
in bed.' And the way she lifted her chin
and eyebrows would be dangerous for you to
try.</p>

<p>"'I tell you it's a reflection on Yorkburg's
mode of life,' she went on. 'For two
hundred years people have come and gone in
this town, and rooms have never been mentioned.
But this is a degenerate age. Degenerate!
Scandalous wealth shouldn't be recognized,
and I don't intend to countenance it
myself!'</p>

<p>"But she will." And Miss Webb took up
her muff to go. "She bought a pair of cream-colored
kid gloves from Miss Patty, and she's
going to wear them at that ball. You couldn't
keep her away."</p>

<p>And she was there. The first one, they say.
She had on the dress her Grandmother wore
when her great-grandfather was minister to
something in Europe; and when she sailed
around the rooms with the big, high comb in
her hair that was her great-great-grandmother's,
Miss Webb says she was the best
side-show on the grounds.</p>

<p>But if you were to take a gimlet and bore a
hole in Mrs. Rodman's head, you couldn't make
her believe anybody would smile at Her.</p>

<p>She was Mrs. General Rodman, born Mason,
and the best blood in Virginia was in her veins.
Also in her father's, as she put on his tombstone.</p>

<p>Outside of Virginia she didn't think anybody
was really anything. Of course, she knew
there were other states where things were done
that made money, but she'd just wave her hand
if you mentioned them.</p>

<p>As for a Yankee! I wouldn't like to put in
words what she does think of a Yankee.</p>

<p>She lost a husband and two brothers and a
father and four nephews and an uncle in the
war; and all her money; and her house had
to be sold; and her baby died before its father
saw it; and, of course, that makes a difference.
It makes a Yankee real personal.</p>

<p>But Miss Katherine don't feel that way about
Yankees. Each of her brothers married one,
and she don't seem to mind.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine went to the ball, too. She
gave in, after all, and went.</p>

<p>I wish you could have seen her when she was
dressed and all ready to go. She had on a long,
white satin dress, low neck and short sleeves,
with little trimming and no jewelry. And she
looked so tall and beautiful, and so something I
didn't have a name for, that I was afraid, and my
heart beat so thick and fast I thought she'd hear.</p>

<p>I hated it. Hated that satin dress, and the
places where she wore it when away from the
Asylum; and I sat up in bed, for lying down
it was hard to breathe.</p>

<p>Presently she turned from the fire where
she had been standing, looking in, and came
toward me and kissed me good-night.</p>

<p>In her face was something I had never seen
before&mdash;something so quiet and proud that I
couldn't sleep for a long time after she went
away.</p>

<p>It wasn't just the same as the remembrance
look I had seen several times before, when she
forgot she wasn't by herself. It was prouder
than that, and it meant something that didn't
get better&mdash;just worse.</p>

<p>What was it? If it's a man, who is he? He
must be living, for it isn't the look that means
something is dead. It means something that
won't die, but is never, never going to be told.</p>

his world is a hard place to live in.
I wish somebody would tell me what
we are born for anyway, and what's
the use of living.</p>

<p>There are so many things that hurt,
and you get so mixed up trying to
understand, that if you don't keep busy you'll
spend your life guessing at a puzzle that hasn't
any answer.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine has gone away. Gone to
stay two months, anyhow. Maybe three.</p>

<p>Her Army brother, the one who is a Captain,
has been sent to Texas, and his wife and children
were taken ill as soon as they got there.</p>

<p>Of course, they sent for Miss Katherine;
that is, asked her by telegraph if she wouldn't
come. She went. And she'll be going to
somebody all her life, for she's the kind that is
turned to when things go wrong.</p>

<p>Miss Webb is awful worried. She says a cool
head and a warm heart are always worked to
death, and the person who has them is forever
on call.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine has them.</p>

<p>She had to go, of course. We were not sick,
except a few snifflers. We didn't exactly need
her, and her brother did; but oh the difference
her being away makes!</p>

<p>Three months of doing without her is like
three months of daylight and no sunlight. It's
like things to eat that haven't any taste; like a
room in which the one you wait for never comes.</p>

<p>I am back in No. 4, in one of the thirteen
beds. My body goes on doing the same things.
Gets up at five o'clock. Dresses, cleans, prays,
eats, goes to school, eats, sews, plays, eats,
studies, goes to bed. And that's got to be done
every day in the same way it was done the day
before.</p>

<p>But it's just my body that does them. Outside
I am a little machine wound up; inside I
am a thousand miles away, and doing a thousand
other things. Some day I am going to
blow up and break my inside workings, for I
wasn't meant to run regular and on time. I
wasn't.</p>

<p>What was I meant for? I don't know. But
not to be tied to a rope. And that's what I
am. Tied to a rope. If I were a boy I'd cut it.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I am almost crazy! A wonderful thing has
happened. I am so excited my breathing is as
bad as old Miss Betsy Hays's. I believe I
know who I am.</p>

<p>My heart is jumping and thumping and carrying
on so that it makes my teeth chatter; and
as I can't tell anybody what I've heard, I am
likely to die from keeping it to myself.</p>

<p>I am <i>not</i> going to die until I find out. If I
did I would be as bad off in heaven as on earth.
Even an angel would prefer to know something
about itself.</p>

<p>I'm like Miss Bray now. I'm counting on
going to heaven. Otherwise it wouldn't make
any difference who I was, as one more misery
don't matter when you're swamped in miserableness.
I suppose that's what hell is:
Miserableness.</p>

<p>What are you when you don't go to heaven?</p>

<p>But that's got nothing to do with how I
found out who I am. It's like Martha, though:
always butting in with questions no Mary on
earth could answer.</p>

<p>Well, the way I found out was one of those
mysterious ways in which God works his wonders.
Yesterday afternoon I asked Miss Bray
if I could go over and play with the Moon children,
three of whom are sick, and she said I
might. We were in the nursery, which is next
to Mrs. Moon's bedroom, and she and the lady
from Michigan, who is visiting her, were talking
and paying no attention to us. Presently something
the lady said&mdash;her name is Mrs. Grey&mdash;made
everything in me stop working, and my
heart gave a little click like a clock when the
pendulum don't swing right.</p>

<p>She was sitting with her back to the door,
which was open, and I could see her, but she
couldn't see me. All of a sudden she put down
her sewing and looked at Mrs. Moon as if something
had just come to her.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth Moon, I believe I know that
child's uncle," she said. "Ever since you told
me about her something has been bothering
me. Didn't you say her mother had a brother
who years ago went West?"</p>

<p>"Hush," said Mrs. Moon, and she nodded
toward me. "She'll hear you, and the ladies
wouldn't like it."</p>

<p>She lowered her voice so I couldn't hear all
she said, but I heard something about its being
the only thing Yorkburg ever did keep quiet
about. And only then because everybody felt
so sorry for her. In a flash I knew they were
talking about me.</p>

<p>After the first understanding, which made
everything in me stop, everything got moving,
and all my inward workings worked double
quick. Why my heart didn't get right out on
the floor and look up at me. I don't know. I
kept on talking and making up wild things just
to keep the children quiet, but I had to hold
myself down to the floor. To help, I put Billy
and Kitty Lee both in my lap.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do was to go to Mrs. Moon
and say: "I am twelve and a half, and I've got
the right to know. I want to hear about my
uncle. I don't want to know him, he not caring
to know me." But before I could really think
Mrs. Grey spoke again.</p>

<p>"He has no idea his sister left a child. He
told me she married very young, and died a
year afterward; and he had heard nothing
from her husband since. As soon as I go home
I am going to tell him. I certainly am."</p>

<p>"You had better not," said Mrs. Moon.
"It's been thirteen years since he left Yorkburg,
and, as he has never been back, he evidently
doesn't care to know anything about it.
I don't think the ladies would like you to tell.
They are very proud of having kept so quiet
out of respect to her father's wishes. If Parke
Alden had wanted to learn anything, he could
have done it years ago."</p>

<p>"But I tell you he doesn't know there's anything
to learn." And the Michigan lady's voice
was as snappy as the place she came from.
"I know Dr. Alden well," she went on. "He's
operated on me twice, and I've spent weeks in
his hospital. When he tells me it's best for
my head to come off&mdash;off my head is to come.
And when a man can make people feel that
way about him, he isn't the kind that's not
square on four sides.</p>

<p>"I tell you, he doesn't know about this child.
He's often talked to me about Yorkburg, knowing
you were my cousin. He told me of his
sister running away with an actor and marrying
him, and dying a year later. Also of his
father's death and the sale of the old home,
and of many other things. There's no place
on earth he loves as he does Virginia. He
doesn't come back because there's no one to
come to see specially. No real close kin, I
mean. The changes in the place where you
were born make a man lonelier than a strange
city does, and something seems to keep him
away."</p>

<p>"You say he doesn't know his sister left a
child?" Mrs. Moon put down the needle she
was trying to thread, and stuck it in her work.
"Why doesn't he know?"</p>

<p>"Why should he? Who was there to tell
him, if a bunch of women made up their minds
he shouldn't know? He wrote to his sister
again and again, but whether his letters ever
reached her he never knew. He thinks not, as
it was unlike her not to write if they were
received.</p>

<p>"Travelling from place to place with her
actor husband, who, he said, was a 'younger son
Englishman,' the letters probably miscarried,
and not for months after her death did he
know she was dead."</p>

<p>"We didn't, either," interrupted Mrs. Moon.
"In fact, we heard it through Parke, who went
West after his father's death. He wrote Roy
Wright, telling him about it."</p>

<p>"Who is Roy Wright, and where is he, that
he didn't tell Dr. Alden about the child?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Roy's dead. I believe Mary Alden's
marriage broke Roy's heart; that is, if a
man's heart can be broken. He had been in
love with her all her life. Not just loved her,
but in love with her. His house was next to
the Aldens', where the Reagans now live, and
Major Alden and General Wright were old
friends, each anxious for the match. When
Mary ran away at seventeen and married a
man her father didn't know, I tell you Yorkburg
was scared to death."</p>

<p>"Do you remember it?"</p>

<p>"Remember! I should think I did. I cried
for two weeks. Nearly ruined my eyes. Mary
and I were deskmates at Miss Porterfield's
school, and I adored her. I really did. So
did Dick Moon." She stopped. Then: "Like
most women, I'm a compromise," and she
laughed. But it was a happy laugh. Mrs. Grey
smiled too.</p>

<p>"Was Mary Alden engaged to Roy Wright
when she married the other man?" she asked.
"Tell me all about her."</p>

<p>"No, she wasn't. Mary Alden was incapable
of deceit, and Roy Wright knew she didn't
love him. He knew she was never going to
marry him. Poor Roy! He was as gentle and
sweet and patient as Mary was high-spirited and
beautiful, and the last type on earth to win a
woman of Mary's temperament. She wanted
to be mastered, and Roy could only worship."</p>

<p>"And her father&mdash;what did he do?"</p>

<p>"Do? The Aldens are not people who 'do'
things. The day after the news came, he and
General Wright walked arm and arm all over
Yorkburg, and their heads were high; but oh,
my dear, it was pitiful. They didn't know, but
they were clinging to each other, and the Major's
face was like death."</p>

<p>"Didn't some one say he had been pretty
strict with her? Held too tight a rein?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he had, and he deserved part of his
suffering. His pride was inherited, and Mary
could go with no one whose great-grandparents
he didn't know about. But Mary cared no
more for ancestors than she did for Hottentots.
When she met this Mr. Cary, a young English
actor, at a friend's house in Baltimore, she made
no inquiry as to whether he had any, and fell
in love at once. He was a gentleman, however.
That was as evident as Major Alden's rage
when he went to see the latter, and asked for
Mary. Mrs. Rodman happened to be in the
house at the time, and what she didn't see
she heard. She says the one thing you can't
fool her about is a counterfeit gentleman. And
Ralston Cary was no counterfeit."</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, don't get on what Mrs.
Rodman thinks or says. Tell me about the
marriage. I'm asking a lot of questions, but
you're so slow."</p>

<p>"I'm telling as fast as I can. You interrupt
so much with questions I can't finish." And
Mrs. Moon's voice was real spunky.</p>

<p>"They were married in Washington," she
began again. "The morning after the interview
with the Major they caught the five-o'clock
train, and that afternoon there was a telegram
telling of the marriage.</p>

<p>"Her father never forgave Mary. Seven
months later he died, and after settling up
affairs there was nothing left. Alden House
was mortgaged to the limit. There were a
number of small debts as well as two or three
large ones, and when these were paid and all
accounts squared there was barely enough
left for Parke to buy his railroad ticket to some
city out West, where he had secured a place
as resident physician in a hospital. That was
thirteen years ago." She took a deep breath,
as if thinking. "Thirteen years. Since then
we've known little about him. You say he is
a famous surgeon? We've never heard it in
Yorkburg."</p>

<p>"Of course you haven't. Yorkburg has heard
nothing since 1865. But there are a good many
things it could hear." And Mrs. Grey laughed,
but with her forehead wrinkled, as if she were
trying to understand something that was
puzzling her.</p>

<p>And then it was Mrs. Moon said something
that made understanding come rolling right in
on me. The answer to that look on Miss
Katherine's face the night of the Reagans' ball
was as plain as Jimmie Jenkins's nose, which is
most all you see when you see Jimmie. It was
like I thought. It was a man.</p>

<p>"Ophelia," said Mrs. Moon, and she moved
her chair closer to Mrs. Grey, and leaned forward
with her hands clasped, "did you ever
hear Doctor Alden speak of a Miss Trent&mdash;Miss
Katherine Trent?"</p>

<p>"No. You mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; she's the one. Parke Alden and
Katherine Trent were sweethearts from children.
Shortly after Mary's marriage something
happened. There was a misunderstanding
of some kind, and they barely bowed when
they met. Everybody was sorry, for it was
one of the matches Heaven might have made
without discredit. Soon after Parke went
away, Katherine went off to some school just
outside of Philadelphia, and, so far as is known,
they've never seen each other since."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grey brought both hands down on her
knees. "I knew it was something like that.
I knew it! Doctor Alden is just that sort of
a man. And it's Katherine Trent? I wish I'd
known it before she went away."</p>

<p>"What would you have done?" Mrs. Moon
looked frightened. She's very timid, Mrs. Moon
is, and always afraid of telling something she
oughtn't. "What could you have done?"</p>

<p>"Looked at her better. She's certainly good
to look at. Not beautiful, but a face you never
forget. And Doctor Alden is the kind that
never forgets. But tell me something about
the child. How did she get here?"</p>

<p>"Her nurse brought her. Her father kept
her after her mother's death, taking her about
from place to place with this old negro mammy
until she was three, when he died suddenly,
strange to say, in the same place his wife died,
Mobile, Alabama."</p>

<p>"Why did the nurse bring her here? Was
she a Yorkburg darkey?"</p>

<p>"No; but she had heard Mr. Cary say there
was an Orphan Asylum here, and not knowing
what else to do, she came on with her. She
told the Board ladies she had heard the child's
father say a hundred times he would rather
see her dead than have her mother's family
take her. And she begged them not to let it
be known who she was until she was old enough
to understand."</p>

<p>Just then Bobbie Moon laid out flat on his back
and kicked up his heels. And Billie looked so
disgusted, I stopped the story I was trying to tell.</p>

<p>"You ain't talking sense," he said. "And
I'm not going to listen any more. An ant
can't eat an elephant in half an hour and leave
no scraps." And he rolled over and began to
fight Bobbie.</p>

<p>Sarah Sue and Myrtle, who'd been playing
with their mother's muff and tippet, got to
fussing so about which should have her hat
that Mrs. Moon, hearing it, jumped up, and I
heard her say:</p>

<p>"Mercy me! Do you suppose she heard?"</p>

<p>I never was so glad of a fight in my life. The
more fuss was made the more chance there was
of my being forgot, and presently I told Mrs.
Moon I had to go home. The boys said they
didn't care, my stories were rotten anyhow,
and out I went and ran so fast I had such a pain
in my side I could hardly breathe.</p>

<p>But I didn't go in right away. I couldn't.
Inside of me everything was thumping: "Mary
Alden, your Mother; Mary Alden, your Mother;
Mary Alden, your Mother." There was no
other thought but that.</p>

<p>Presently I turned and went down to King
Street, to where the Reagans live, and in the
dark I stood there and shook my fist at my
dead grandfather. I hated him for treating
my mother so. Hated him! Then I burst out
crying, and cried so awful my eyes were nearly
washed out.</p>

<p>There were twelve and a half years' worth of
tears that had to come out, and I let them
come. After they were out I felt lighter.</p>

<p>But sleep? There wasn't a blink of it for
me all night. I was so mixed up with new
feelings that I was sick in my stomach, and
my old conscience got so sanctimonious that
if I could have spanked it I would.</p>

<p>I wasn't eavesdropping; I know that's
nasty. But forty times I'd been punished for
speaking when I shouldn't, and, besides, it was
my duty to find myself. They saw me, and then
forgot. If they hadn't wanted me to know what
they were saying, they shouldn't have said it.</p>

<p>But that didn't do my conscience any good.
I hate a conscience. It's always making you
feel low down and disreputable. I don't believe
I will say anything to my children about
one, and let them have some peace.</p>

<p>For two days I didn't have any. Then I
decided I'd wait until Miss Katherine came,
and not say anything to her or to anybody
about what I'd heard until I found out a little
more about that remembrance in her face.
But the waiting for her is the longest wait I've
ever waited through yet.</p>

<p>It certainly is queer what a surprise you are
to yourself. Before I knew that my mother
and her father and his father and some other
fathers behind him had lived in the Alden
House, I would have given all I own, which
isn't much, just my body, to have known it.
And I guess I would have been that airy Martha
couldn't have lived with me, and would have
had to take Mary to the pump to bring her
senses back with water. Mary is my best part,
but at times she hasn't half the common sense
she needs, and frequently has a pride Martha
has to attend to.</p>

<p>But after I found out I had the same kind
of blood in me that Mrs. General Rodman had
in her, though I'm thankful it isn't mentioned
on the family's tombstones, it didn't seem half
as big a thing as I thought.</p>

<p>I was ashamed of the way it had acted, and
of the way it had treated my father. He was
too much of a gentleman to talk about his,
whether high or low, and I know nothing about
him. But I adore his memory! I am his
child as well as Mary Alden's, and that's a
thing my children are never going to forget.
Never.</p>

<p>And now the part I'm thinking of most is
what was said about Miss Katherine and Dr.
Parke Alden being sweethearts when they were
young. He has been away thirteen years, Mrs.
Moon said, and Miss Katherine is now twenty-eight.
I know she is, because she told me so.</p>

<p>Thirteen from twenty-eight leaves fifteen, so
she was fifteen when they had that fuss and he
went off. Fifteen was awful young to love
hard and permanent; but Miss Webb says Miss
Katherine was born grown and stubborn, and
when she once takes a stand she keeps it.</p>

<p>I wonder what she took the stand with Uncle
Parke for? She is right quick and outspoken
at times, and I bet he made her mad about
something.</p>

<p>But she ought to have known he was a man,
and not expected much. I know my children's
father is going to make me so hopping at times
I could shake him. If he didn't, he would be
terrible stupid to live with, and nothing wears
you out like stupidness. I don't really mind
a scrap. It's so nice to make up.</p>

<p>But I believe that's the reason Miss Katherine
don't get married. Because in her secret heart
Dr. Parke Alden is still her sweetheart. I know
in his secret heart she is still his. She's bound
to be if she ever once was.</p>

<p>Glorious superbness! Wouldn't that be
grand? If they were to get married she would
be my really, truly Aunt! The very thought
makes me so full of thrills I can't sit still when
it comes over me.</p>

<p>Oh, Mary Martha Cary, what a beautiful
place this world could be!</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/a.png" alt="A" title="A" /></div><p>
 secret isn't any pleasure. What's
the use of knowing a thing you can't
let anybody know you know? If
I can't tell soon what I've heard
about myself something is liable to
happen.</p>

<p>Nearly three months have passed, and I
haven't told yet. I'm still holding out, but it's
the most awful experience I ever had.</p>

<p>Another idea has come to me, and if I could
see Miss Katherine I could tell whether to do
it or not. If she don't come soon I will do it,
anyhow. I won't be able to help it.</p>

<p>The girls say if I were a darkey they'd think
I was seeking. That's because some days I'm
so unnatural quiet and stay so much by myself.
I do that for safety, fearing otherwise I'd
speak.</p>

<p>They don't know what's going on inside of
me. If they could see they'd find nothing but
quiverings and questions, and if I don't do
anything really violent it's all I ask.</p>

<p>Every morning and every night my prayers
are just this: "O Lord, help Mary Cary through
this day. I'm not asking for to-morrow, it not
being here yet. But <i>This Day</i> help me to hold
out." And all day long I'm saying under my
breath:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"Hold on, Mary Cary, hold on, hold on.<br /></span>
<span>There never was a night that didn't have a dawn.<br /></span>
<span>There never was a road that didn't have an end.<br /></span>
<span>Wait awhile, wait awhile, and then the letter send."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I say that so often to myself that I'm afraid
somebody will hear me think it. If that letter
isn't sent soon, the answer will be received by a
corpse.</p>

<p>I'm never again going to have a secret. It's
worse than a tumor or dropsy. Mrs. Penick
has a tumor. I've never seen the dropsy, but
a secret is more dangerous, for it dries you up.
Dropsy has water to it.</p>

<p>We had apple-dumplings for dinner. I
sold mine to Lucy Pyle for two cents, and
bought a stamp with it. The stamp is for
The Letter.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine has come back. Came night
before last, but I've been too excited to write
anything down. Everything I do is done in
dabs these days, and few lines at the time is
all I'm equal to.</p>

<p>She looks grand. And oh, what a difference
her being here makes! We are children, not
just orphans, when she is with us; and it's because
she loves us, trusts us, brings our best
part to the top that we are different when she
is about. The very way she laughs&mdash;so clear
and hearty&mdash;makes you think things aren't so
bad, and already they have picked up. Like
my primrose does when I give it water, after
forgetting it till it is as limp as old Miss Sarah
Cone's cr&ecirc;pe veil.</p>

<p>I haven't told her anything yet, but I've
been watching good. I haven't seen any particular
signs of memories and regrets, she being
too busy to have them since she got back.
Still, I believe they are there, and I'm that
afraid I'll say Parke Alden in my sleep I put the
covering over my head, for fear she'd hear me
if I did.</p>

<p>I am back in her room, and this afternoon
she asked me what I was looking at her so hard
for. I told her she was the best thing to look
at that came my way, and she laughed and
called me a foolish child. But Mary Cary is
thinking, and she isn't telling all she thinks
about, either.</p>

<p>Well, it's written. That letter is written and
gone. It was to Dr. Parke Alden. I sent it
to his hospital in Michigan. I made it short,
because by nature I write just endless, having
gotten in the habit from making up stories for
the girls and scribbling them off when kept in,
which in the past was frequent. This is what
I wrote:</p>

<blockquote><p>DR. PARKE ALDEN:</p>

<p><i>Dear Sir</i>,&mdash;Eleven weeks and two days ago I heard
you did not know I was living. I am. I live in the
Yorkburg Female Orphan Asylum, and have been
living here for nine years and four months and almost
a week. If you had known I was living all
these years and had not made yourself acquainted
with me, I would not now write you. But I heard,
by accident, you did not know I had been born, so
I am writing to tell you I was. It happened in
Natchez, Miss. I know that much, but little more,
except my father was an actor. I worship his memory.
My mother was named Mary Alden, and you
are her brother. If you would like to know more,
and will write and ask me, I think you will learn
something of interest. Not about me, but there are
other people in this world.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>MARY CARY.</p></blockquote>

<p>Three days have passed since I sent that
letter off secret. I wouldn't let Miss Katherine
know for a billion dollars that I'd sent it, but
I'm glad I did. I'm sure she's got something
in her heart she don't talk about, for last night,
when she didn't know I was looking, I saw that
same quiet proudness come in her face I saw
the night of the ball.</p>

<p>I don't know how long it takes to go to
Michigan, not knowing much about travelling,
as I've never been out of Yorkburg since I
came in. But some day I'm going around the
world, and I'm going to see everything anybody
else has ever seen before I marry my
children's father. Of course, after I get married
he will be busy, and there will be always
some excuse that will make you tired. I'm
going beforehand. Miss Webb says marriage
is very uncertain.</p>

<p>This is a grand day. The crocuses are peeping
up just as pert and pretty. The little brown
buds on the trees have turned green and getting
bigger every day, and even the air feels like
it's had a bath. I just love the spring. Everything
says to you: "Good-morning! Here we
are again. Let's begin all over." And inside
I say, "All right," and I mean it; but oh, Mary
Cary, you're so unreliable. There are times
when your future looks very much like a worm
of the dust.</p>

<p>Miss Bray is real sick. She hasn't been well
for a long time, and she looks like she's shrivelling,
though still fat. She has nervous dyspepsia,
which they say is ruinous to dispositions,
and Miss Bray's isn't the kind for any sort of
sickness to be free with.</p>

<p>It certainly is making her queer, for she's
changed from sharpness to tearfulness, and she
weeps any time. A thing I never thought I'd
live to see.</p>

<p>Poor creature, I feel real sorry for her. Miss
Jones says she's worn out, but I don't believe
it's that. I believe it's conscience and coffee.
Miss Bray isn't an all-over bad person. If it
wasn't I knew she told stories, I could have
stood the other things. But when a person
tells stories, what have you got to hold on to?
Nothing.</p>

<p>I believe it's those stories that's giving her
trouble in her stomach. Anything on your
mind does, and Miss Bray looks at me so curious
and so nervous, sometimes, that I can't
help feeling sorry for her.</p>

<p>I don't believe she will ever get well until
she repents and confesses and crosses her heart
that she won't do it again. A confession is a
grand relief.</p>

<p>Suppose Dr. Parke Alden don't write, don't
notice me! I will be that mad and mortified
I will wish I was dead. But if he don't answer
that letter, I will write a few more things to
him before dying, for, if I am an Orphan, I
oughtn't to be treated like a piece of imagination.</p>

<p>The black hen has got a lot of little chickens
and the jonquils are in bloom. The sun is as
warm as June, but I'm shivering all the time,
and Miss Katherine says she don't understand
me. She gave me a tonic to make me eat
more. I don't want to eat. I want a letter.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Jerusalem the Golden! Now, what do you
reckon has happened! Nothing will evermore
surprise Mary Cary, mostly Martha.</p>

<p>If the moon ever burns, or the stars come to
town, or the Pope marries a wife, or the dead
come to life, I will just say, "Is that so?" and
in my heart I will know a stranger thing than
that.</p>

<p>Yesterday Miss Bray sent for me to come to
her room. She was sick in bed, and her frizzes
weren't frizzed, and she looked so old and
pitiful that I took hold of her hand and said,
"I'm awful sorry you are sick, Miss Bray."</p>

<p>And what did she do but begin to cry, and
such a long crying I never saw anybody have.
I knew there was a lot to come out and she'd
better get rid of it, so I let it keep on without
remarks, and after a while she told me to shut
the door, and get her a clean handkerchief out
of her top bureau-drawer.</p>

<p>I did it. Then she told me to sit down. I
did that, too, and it's well I did. If I hadn't
I'd have fell. Her words would have made
me.</p>

<p>"Mary Cary," she said, "you have given me
a great deal of trouble, and at times you've
nearly worried me to death. But never since
you've been here have you ever told a story,
and that's what I've done." And she put her
head down in her pillow, and I tell you she
nearly shook herself, out of bed she cried so.</p>

<p>I was so surprised and confused I didn't
know whether I was awake or asleep. But all
of a sudden it came to me what she meant, and
I put my arms around her neck and kissed her.
That's what I did, Martha or no Martha; I
kissed her. Then I said:</p>

<p>"Miss Bray, I'm awful glad you are sorry
you did it. If you're sorry it's like a sponge
that wipes it off, and don't anybody but you
and me and God know about that particular
one. And we can all forget it, if there's never
any more."</p>

<p>And then she cried harder than ever. Regular
rivers. I didn't know the top of your head
could hold so much water.</p>

<p>But she said there would never be any more,
for she'd never had any peace since the way I
looked at her that day, and she couldn't stand
it any longer. She didn't know why I had
that effect on her, but I did, and she'd sent for
me to talk about it.</p>

<p>Well, we talked. I told her I didn't think
just being sorry was enough, and I asked her
how sorry was she.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she said, and then she began
on tears again, so I thought I'd better be
quick while the feeling lasted.</p>

<p>"Well, you know, Miss Bray," I began,
"Pinkie Moore hasn't been adopted yet. She
never will be while the ladies think what you
told them is true. You ought to write a letter
to the Board and tell them what you said
wasn't so."</p>

<p>"I can't!" she said; and then more fountains
flowed. "I can't tell them I told a story!"</p>

<p>"But that's what you did," I said. "And
when you've done a mean thing, there isn't but
one way to undo it&mdash;own up and take what
comes. But it's nothing to a conscience that's
got you, and is never going to let you go until
you do the square thing. If you want peace,
it's the only way to get it."</p>

<p>"But I can't write a letter; I'm so nervous
I couldn't compose a line." And you never
would have known her voice. It was as quavery
as old Doctor Fleury's, the Methodist preacher
who's laid off from work.</p>

<p>"I'll write it for you." And I hopped for
the things in her desk. "You can copy it
when you feel better." And, don't you know,
she let me do it! After three tryings I finished
it, then read it out loud:</p>

<blockquote><p>DEAR LADIES,&mdash;If any one applies for Pinkie Moore,
I hope you will let her go. Pinkie is the best and
most useful girl in the Asylum. More than two years
ago I said differently. It was wrong in me, and Pinkie
isn't untruthful. She hasn't a bad temper, and never
in her life took anything that didn't belong to her.
I am sorry I said what I did. She don't know it
and never will, and I hope you will forgive me for
saying it.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>MOLLIE E. BRAY.</p></blockquote>

<p>When I was through she cried still harder,
and said she'd lose her place. She knew she
would. I told her she wouldn't. I knew she
wouldn't. And after a while she sat up in
bed and copied it. Some of her tears blotted
it, but I told her that didn't matter, and when
I got up to go she looked better already.</p>

<p>I knew how she felt. Like I did when my
tooth that had to come out was out. And a
thing on your mind is worse than the toothache.
One you can tell, the other you can't.
A thing you can't tell is like a spook that's
always behind you, and right in the bed with
you when you wake up sudden, and lies down
with you every time you go to sleep. I know,
for that letter is on my mind.</p>

<p>When I got out of Miss Bray's room I ran
in mine, Miss Katherine being out, and locked
the door, and I said:</p>

<p>"Mary Martha Cary, don't ever say again
there's no such things as modern miracles.
There's been a miracle to-day, and you have
seen it. Somebody has been born over." And
then, because I couldn't help it, I cried almost
as bad as Miss Bray.</p>

<p>But, oh, nobody can ever know how much
harm it had done me to believe a lady could go
through life telling stories, and doing mean, dishonorable
things, and not minding. And people
treating her just the same as if she were honest!</p>

<p>When I found out it wasn't so&mdash;that your sin
did make you suffer, and that it did make a
difference trying to do right&mdash;I felt some of
my old Martha-ry scornfulness slipping away.
And I got down on my knees, no words, but
God understanding why.</p>

<p>I don't like any kind of bitterness in my
heart. I'd rather like people. But can you
like a deceiver? You can't.</p>

<p>Dr. Parke Alden has taken no more notice
of me than if I were a Juney-bug.</p>

<p>I wonder if Miss Katherine will ever marry.
She wasn't meant to live in an Orphan Asylum.
She was meant to be the Lady of the House,
and to wear beautiful clothes, and have horses
and carriages and children of her own, and to
give orders. Instead of that, she is here; but
sometimes she has a look on her face which I
call "Waiting." Last week I wrote a poem
about it. This is it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>"In the winter, by the fireside, when the snow falls soft and white,<br /></span>
<span>I am waiting, hoping, longing, but for what I don't know quite.<br /></span>
<span>And when summer's sunshine shimmers, and the birds sing clear and sweet,<br /></span>
<span>I am waiting, always waiting, for the joy I hope to meet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>It will be, I think, my husband, and the home he'll make for me;<br /></span>
<span>But of his coming or home-making, I as yet no signs do see.<br /></span>
<span>But I still shall keep on waiting, for I know it's true as fate,<br /></span>
<span>When you really, truly hustle, things will come if just you'll wait."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I don't think much of that. It sounds like
"Dearest Willie, thou hast left us, and thy loss
we deeply feel." But I wasn't meant for a
poet any more than Miss Katherine for an old
maid.</p>

<p>Dr. Parke Alden must be dead. Either that
or he's no gentleman, or he didn't get my letter.
I wish I hadn't written it. I wish I hadn't let
him know I was living. But it was Miss
Katherine I was thinking about. Thank Heaven,
I didn't mention her name! He isn't worth
thinking about, and I think of nothing else.</p>

<h2>HIS COMING</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i.png" alt="I" title="I" /></div><p>
f I could get out on the roof and shake
hands with the stars, or dance with
the man in the moon, I might be able
to write it down; but everything in
me is bubbling and singing so, I can't
keep still to write. But I'm bound
to put down that he's come. He's come!</p>

<p>He came day before yesterday morning about
ten o'clock. I was in the school-room, and
Mrs. Blamire opened the door and looked in.
"Mary Cary can go to the parlor," she said.
"Some one wishes to see her."</p>

<p>I got up and went out, not dreaming who it
was, as I was only looking for a letter; and
there, standing by a window with his back to
me, was a man, and in a minute I knew.</p>

<p>I couldn't move, and I couldn't speak, and
Lot's wife wasn't any stiller than I was.</p>

<p>But he heard me come in, and turned, and,
oh! it is so strange how right at once you know
some things. And the thing I knew was it was
all true. That he'd never known about me
until he got my letter. For a minute he just
looked at me. We didn't either of us say a
word, and then he came toward me and held
out his hands.</p>

<p>"Mary Cary," he said. And the first thing
I knew I was crying fit to break my heart, with
my arms around his neck, and he holding me
tight in his. His eyes were wet, too. They
were. I saw them. He kissed me about fifty
times&mdash;though maybe not more than twenty&mdash;and
I had such a strange feeling I didn't know
whether I was in my body or not. It was the
first time that any one who was really truly my
own had ever come to see me since I'd been an
Orphan, and every bit of sense I ever had rolled
away like the Red Sea waters. Rolled right away.</p>

<p>I don't remember what happened next.
Everything is a jumble of so many kinds of
joys that I've been crazy all day. But I wasn't
too crazy to see the look on his face, I mean on
my Uncle Dr. Parke Alden's face, when he saw
Miss Katherine coming across the front yard.
We were standing by the window, and as he
saw her he looked again, as if he didn't see
good, and then his face got as white as whitewash.
He took out his handkerchief and wiped
his lips and his forehead that were real perspiring,
and I almost danced for joy, for I
knew in his secret, secret heart she was his
sweetheart still. But I didn't move even a
toe. I just said:</p>

<p>"That's Miss Katherine Trent. She's the
trained nurse here. Did you know her when
she lived in Yorkburg?"</p>

<p>And he said yes, he knew her. Just that,
and nothing else. But I knew, and for fear I'd
tell him I knew, I flew out of the room like I
was having a fit, and met Miss Katherine coming
in the front door.</p>

<p>"Miss Katherine," I said, "there's a friend
of yours in the parlor who wants to see you.
Will you go in?"</p>

<p>She walked in, just as natural, humming a
little tune, and I walked behind her, for I
wanted to see it. I will never be as ready for
glory as I was that minute. I could have
folded my hands and sailed up, but I didn't sail.
It's well I didn't, for they didn't meet at all
like I expected, and I was so surprised I just
said, "Well, sir!" and sat right down on the
floor and looked up at them.</p>

<p>They didn't see me. They didn't see anything
but each other; but if they'd had the
smallpox they couldn't have kept farther apart,
just bowing formal, and not even offering to
shake hands.</p>

<p>My, I was set on! I didn't think they'd meet
that way; but Miss Becky Cole, who's kinder
crazy, says God Almighty don't know what a
woman is going to do or when she's going to
do it. Miss Katherine proved it. She didn't
fool me, though, with all her quietness and coolness.
I knew her heart was beating as hard
as mine, and I jumped up and said:</p>

<p>"I think you all have been waiting long
enough to make up, and it's no use wasting any
more time." And I flew out, slamming the
door tight, and shut them in.</p>

<p>I don't know what happened after I shut that
door. But, oh, he's grand! He is thirty-six,
and big and splendid. He and Miss Katherine
are in the parlor now. Miss Jones says everybody
in Yorkburg knows he's here, and all
talking. All!</p>

<p>I've been so excited since the first day he
came that I've had little sense. But my natural
little is coming back, and I'm trying not to talk
too much. Of course, I had to say a good
deal, because everybody had to know how it
happened that Doctor Alden came back to
Yorkburg so suddenly after thirteen years' being
away. And why he hadn't been before, and
what he came for and when he was going away,
and if he were going to take me with him.</p>

<p>And then everybody remembered how he
and Miss Katherine used to be sweethearts
when they were young. I tell you, the talking
that's been going on in Yorkburg in the last
few days would fill a barrel of books. By the
end of the week a whole lot more will be known
about Uncle Parke than he knows about himself.
If Yorkburg had a coat of arms it ought
to be a question-mark.</p>

<p>They've had time to talk over everything
that ever happened since Adam and Eve left
Paradise, in the long walks they take, and in the
evenings when he calls, which he does as regular
as night comes. And now I'm waiting for
the news. I'll have to be so surprised. And
I guess I will be. Love does very surprising
things.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine knew where Uncle Parke was
all the time. She knew who I was, too; that is,
she found out after she nursed me at the
hospital. But what that fuss was about I don't
know. Nothing much, I reckon; but the more
you love a person the madder you can get with
them. And from foolishness they've wasted
years and years of together-ness.</p>

<p>But it's all explained now, and I don't think
there's going to be any more nonsense. They
are going to be married as sure as my name
isn't in a bank-book; and if signs are anything,
it's going to be soon.</p>

<p>Miss Bray is better, though she looks pretty
bad still. She's been awfully excited about
Uncle Parke's coming, and she says she hears
he's very distinguished and real rich. Isn't it
strange how quick some people hear about
riches? I don't know anything of his having
any. He hasn't mentioned money to me; but
oh, I feel so safe with him! He's so strong
and quiet and easy in his manners, and he's
been so splendid and beautiful to me. He
don't use many words. Just makes you understand.</p>

<p>I wonder what a man says to a lady when
he wants her to marry him? I know Dr. Parke
Alden isn't the kind to get down on his knees.
If he were, Miss Katherine would certainly tell
him to get up and say what he had to say
standing, or sitting, if it took long. But I'll
never know what he said. They're not the
kind to tell; but they can't hide Love. It's
just like the sun. It can't help shining.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Land of Nippon, I'm excited! I believe he's
said it!</p>

<p>The reason I think so is, I saw them late
yesterday evening coming in from a long walk
down the Calverton road, where there's a beautiful
place for courters. When they got to the
gate they stopped and talked and talked.
Then he walked to the door with her, still
holding his hat in his hand, and though it was
dark I could feel something different. I was
so nervous you would have thought I was the
one.</p>

<p>I was over by the lilacs; but they didn't
see me. I didn't like to move. It might
have been ruinous, so I held my breath and
waited.</p>

<p>When they got to the door they stopped
again, and presently he held out his hand to
say good-bye. The way he did it, the way he
looked at her made me just know, and I got
right down on my knees under the lilac-bush,
and when he'd gone I sang, "Praise God, from
whom all blessings flow." Sang it loud.</p>

<p>I didn't care who heard. I wasn't telling
why I was thankful. Just telling I was. Oh,
Mary Martha Cary, to think of her being your
really, truly Aunt! The very next thing to a
mother!</p>

<h2>THE HURT OF HAPPINESS</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i.png" alt="I" title="I" /></div><p>
 wouldn't like to put on paper
how I feel to-day. Uncle Parke has
gone. Gone back to Michigan. I'm
such a mixture of feelings that I
don't know which I've got the most
of, gladness or sadness or happiness
or miserableness, and I'd rather cry as much
as I want than have as much ice-cream as I
could hold.</p>

<p>But I'm not going to cry. I don't like cryers,
and, besides, I haven't a place to do it in private.
I wouldn't let Miss Katherine see me, not
if I died of choking. I ought to be rejoicing,
and I am; but the female heart is beyond
understanding, Miss Becky Cole says, and it is.
Mine is. I could die of thankfulness, but I'd
like first to cry as much as I could if I let go.</p>

<p>They are engaged. Uncle Parke and Miss
Katherine are, and they are to be married on
the twenty-seventh of June. That's my birthday.
I will be thirteen on the twenty-seventh
of June.</p>

<p>They told me about it night before last. I
was out on the porch, and Miss Katherine called
me and told me she and Doctor Alden wanted
me to go to walk with them. I knew what
was coming. Knew in a flash. But I pretended
not to, and thanked her ever so much, and
told her I'd just love to go.</p>

<p>We walked on down to the Calverton road,
talking about nothing, and making out it was
our usual night walk, but when we got to the
seven maples Uncle Parke stopped.</p>

<p>"Suppose we sit down," he said. "It's too
warm to walk far to-night." And after we
sat he threw his hat on the ground, then leaned
over and took my hands in his.</p>

<p>"Mary Cary," he began. And though his
eyes were smiling, his voice was real quivering.
I was noticing, and it was. "Mary Cary,
Katherine and I have brought you with us to-night
to ask if you have any objection to our
being married. We would like to do so as
soon as possible&mdash;if you do not object."</p>

<p>He turned my face to his, and the look in his
eyes was grand. It meant no matter who objected,
marry her he would; but it was a way to
tell me&mdash;the way he was asking, and I understood.</p>

<p>"It depends," I said, and, as I am always
playing parts to myself, right on the spot I
was a chaperon lady. "It depends on whether
you love enough. Do you?"</p>

<p>"I do. For myself I am entirely sure. As
to Katherine&mdash;Suppose she tells you what
she thinks."</p>

<p>I turned toward her. "Do you, Miss Katherine?
It takes&mdash;I guess it takes a lot of love
to stand marriage. Do you think you have
enough?"</p>

<p>In the moonlight her face changed like her
opal ring when the cream becomes pink and
the pink red.</p>

<p>"I think there is," she said. Then: "Oh,
Mary Cary, why are you such a strange, strange
child?" And she threw her arms around me
and kissed me twenty times.</p>

<p>After a while, after we'd talked and talked,
and they'd told me things and I'd told them
things, I said I'd consent.</p>

<p>"But if the love ever gives out, I'm not
going to stay with you," I said. "I'm never
going to be fashionable and not care for love.
A home without it is hell."</p>

<p>"Mercy, Mary!" Uncle Parke jumped. "Don't
use such strong language. It isn't nice."</p>

<p>"But it's true. I read it in a book, and I've
watched the Rices. When there's love enough
you can stand anything. When there isn't,
you can stand nothing. Living together every
day you find out a lot you didn't know, and
love can't keep still. It's got to grow or
die."</p>

<p>Then I jumped up. "I always could talk a
lot about things I didn't understand," I said.
"But I consent." And I flew down the road
and left them.</p>

<p>I've written it out on a piece of paper, about
their being engaged, and looked at it by night
and by day since they told me about it. I've
said it low, and I've said it loud, but I can't
realize it, and the little sense the Lord gave
me He has taken away.</p>

<p>They say I did it. Say I'm responsible for
every bit of it, and that I will have to look
after them all the rest of their lives to see that
I didn't make a mistake in writing that letter.
And that I'm to go to Europe with them on
their wedding tour and live with them always
and always. And&mdash;oh!&mdash;I believe my heart is
going to burst with miserable happiness and
happy miserableness, and my head feels like
it's in a bag.</p>

<p>Dr. Parke Alden and Miss Katherine Trent
are the two nicest people on earth, and the two
I love best. But I don't think they know all
the time what they are doing and saying.
They are that in love they don't see but one
side&mdash;the happy side&mdash;and they think I am
going to leave this place with a skip and a
jump and run along by them, third person,
single number, and not know I'm in the way.</p>

<p>They won't even listen when I tell them I
don't know what I'm going to do. I know
what I want to do! Everything in me gets
into shivering trembleness when I think I
could go to Europe with them on their wedding
trip. Think of it! Mary Cary could go to
E-U-R-O-P-E!</p>

<p>They've invited me and say I'm to go, because
I'm never to leave them any more, and
they want me. But it isn't so. Mary tries to
believe it's so, but Martha knows it isn't.
They think they think they want me, but they
don't; nobody wants an outsider on a wedding
tour, and I'm not going. I can't help it. Come
on, tears! Even angels sometimes cry aloud;
and, not being a step-relation to one, I'm going
to let Mary cry if she wants to. Sometimes
Martha is real hard on Mary.</p>

<p>There is no use studying Human Nature.
You can't study a thing that changes by day
and by night, and is so uncertain you never
know what it is going to do. Now, here is
Mary Cary, mostly Martha, who would rather
get on a train or a boat and go somewhere&mdash;
she don't care where&mdash;than to do any other
thing on earth. Who has never seen anything
and wants to see everything, and who, if anyone
had told her a year ago she could go to
New York, and then to Europe, would have
slid down every flight of stairs head foremost
from pure joy. And now she has the chance,
she is not going. She is Not.</p>

<p>She hasn't much sense, Mary Cary hasn't,
but enough to know wedding trips are personal,
and, besides, the girls have turned into regular
weepers. Every time anything is said about
going away their eyes water up, and Martha
feels like a yellow dog with no tail. I know
they hate Miss Katherine's going; but why do
they cry about my going? Lord, this is a
strange place to live in, this world is! I wonder
what heaven will be like?</p>

<p>Miss Bray is much better. She says Uncle
Parke has cured her. I don't believe it. I
believe it was Relief of the Mind.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>I wasn't meant to be a sad person. I was
silly sad the other day; but I've found out
when anything bothers you very much, it helps
to take it out and look at it. Walk all around
it, poke it and see if it's sure enough, and, if
it isn't, tell it you'll see it dead before you'll
let it do you that way.</p>

<p>That's what I did with what was making
me doleful, and now I'm all right again. It
was because I did want to go to Europe awful,
and it twisted my heart like a machine had it
when I turned my back on the chance. And
then, too, it was because the girls begged me
so not to go away for good that I got so worried.</p>

<p>They said it wouldn't be the same if I wasn't
here, and though they didn't blame me, they
begged me so not to go that I got as addled
as the old black hen that hatched ducks.</p>

<p>Now, did you ever hear of such a thing? As
if it really mattered where Mary Cary lived!
I didn't know anybody truly cared, and finding
out made me light in the head. But I know
that's just passing&mdash;their caring, I mean. I'm
much obliged; but they'll forget it in a little
while, and I will be just a memory.</p>

<p>I hope it will be bright. There's so much
dark you can't help that a brightness is real
enjoyable. They say what you look for you
see, and what you want to forget you mustn't
remember. There are a lot of things about my
Orphan life I'm going to try to forget. But
there are some that for the sake of sense, and
in case of airs, I had better bear in mind. I
guess Martha will see to those. Whenever
Mary gives signs of soaring, Martha brings her
straight back to earth. Martha doesn't care
for soarers, and she has a terrible bad habit of
letting them know she don't.</p>

<p>Yorkburg hasn't settled down yet, and is still
hanging on to the last remnants of the surprise
about Uncle Parke's coming, and about his
marriage to Miss Katherine and my going
away.</p>

<p>Of course, Miss Amelia Cokeland wanted to
know if he'd made the Asylum a present, and
how much. At first nobody would tell her.
She's got such a ripping curiosity that there
isn't a sneeze sneezed in Yorkburg, or a cake
baked, or a door shut that she doesn't want
to know why. But maybe she can't help it.
Some people are natural inquirers, and that's
the way she makes her living, telling the news.</p>

<p>She used to work buttonholes, but since she
can't see good she just spends the day out and
tells all she hears. Nobody really likes her,
but her tongue is too sharp to fool with. To
keep from being talked about, everybody pretends
to be friendly.</p>

<p>I don't. She shook her finger at me once
because I wouldn't tell her what was in Miss
Katherine's letter the first time she went away,
and since then she's never noticed me until
Uncle Parke came. Now every time I see her
she's awful pleasant, and tries to make me talk.
But a finger once shook is shook. I don't
talk.</p>

<p>But Uncle Parke did make the Asylum a
present. He didn't tell me, neither did Miss
Katherine, and I don't think he wanted anybody
but the Board ladies to know. But, of
course, they couldn't keep it secret. They
told their husbands, and that meant the town.
Nothing but a dead man could keep from talking
about money.</p>

<p>It must have been a lot he gave, for Peelie
Duke told me she heard Mrs. Carr and Mrs.
Dent talking about it the day she took some
apple-jelly for Miss Jones over to little Jessie
Carr, who was sick.</p>

<p>"He could have kept her at a fashionable
boarding-school from the day she was born
until now for the sum he's turned over to the
Board," said Mrs. Carr, and her eyes, which
are the beaming kind, just danced, Peelie
said.</p>

<p>"Well, he ought to," grunted Mrs. Dent,
who talks like her tongue was down her throat.
"He ought to! We've been taking care of the
child for almost ten years. I hear he wants
the house put in good condition, a new dining-room
and kitchen built and four bath-rooms.
The rest is to go to the endowment. I think
more ought to go to the endowment and less
for these luxuries. I don't approve of them.
An Orphan Asylum is not a hotel."</p>

<p>"No, but it ought to be a home, if possible,"
said Mrs. Carr, and Peelie said she looked at
Mrs. Dent like she wondered how under heaven
her husband stood her all the time.</p>

<p>I certainly am glad to know I'm paid for.
Some day, when I'm grown and earning my
own living, before I marry my children's father,
I am going to give as much as I can of that
money back to Uncle Parke. Of course that
will be some time off, and until then I'll just
have to try to be a nice person.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine says a whole lot of people
would pay a big price to have a nice person
in the house with them&mdash;one of those cheerful,
sunshiny kind that helps and is encouraging,
and gets up again when they fall down.
As I can't earn money yet, I'm going to try to
be something like that, so they won't be sorry
I ever was born. Uncle Parke and Miss Katherine
won't.</p>

<p>But isn't it strange, when the time comes
for you to do a thing you are crazy to do, you
wish it hadn't come?</p>

<p>There have been days when I hated this
Asylum. I've felt at times that I was just
one of the numbers of the multiplication
table, and in all my life I'd never be anything
else. And I'd almost sweep the bricks up out
of the yard, I'd be so mad to think I was nothing
and nobody.</p>

<p>I wanted to be something and somebody. I
didn't want to die and be forgotten. I would
have liked to sit on St. John's Church steeple
and have everybody look at me and say:</p>

<p>"That's Mary Cary! She's great and rich,
and gives away lots of money and sings like
an angel." That's what I once would have
liked, but I've learned a few things since I didn't
know then.</p>

<p>One is that high places are lonely and hard
and uncomfortable, and people who have sat on
them have sometimes wished they didn't. Miss
Katherine told me that herself, also that the
place you're in is pretty near what you're
fitted to fill. Otherwise you'd get out and fill
another.</p>

<p>I've given up steeples and superiorities. But
I'm glad I'm not going to be an orphan, just
an orphan, all my life. I'm glad; still, when I
think of going away and leaving everybody and
everything: the old pump, where I drowned
my first little chicken washing it; and the old
mulberry-tree, where my first doll was buried;
and the garret, where I made up ghost-stories
for the girls on rainy days; and the school-room;
and even No. 4&mdash;when I think of these
things, I could be like that man in the Bible
(I believe it was David, but it might have
been Jonah), I could lift up my voice and
weep.</p>

<p>But I'm not going to. Weepers are a
nuisance.</p>

<p>I guess that's the way with life, though.
When things are going, you try to hold them
back. And if you got them, you'd maybe wish
you hadn't.</p>

<p>That's the way Mrs. Gaines did when her
husband died. I mean when he didn't die that
first time. She thought he was going to, and
so did everybody else. He had Fright's disease,
and it affected his heart, being liable to
take him off any time, and Mrs. Gaines just
carried on terrible.</p>

<p>She had faintings and hysterics, and said she
couldn't live without him, though everybody
in Yorkburg knew she could, and easy enough.
He without her, too, had she gone first. She
had asthma and an outbreaking temper, and
he drank.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mosby&mdash;she's the doctor's wife&mdash;said
she didn't blame him. No man could stand
Mrs. Gaines all the time without something to
help, and everybody hoped when he got so ill
that he'd die and have a little rest. But he
didn't. He got better.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gaines was so surprised she was downright
disagreeable about it, and how he stood
it was a wonder. He didn't long, for the next
summer he was dead sure enough, and Mrs.
Gaines put on the longest cr&ecirc;pe veil ever seen
in the South, she said. It touched the hem of
her skirt in front and behind; but she cut it
in half after everybody had seen it often
enough to know how long it was.</p>

<p>If Augustus Gaines thought she was going
to ruin her eyes and choke her lungs by wearing
unhealthy cr&ecirc;pe over her face he thought
wrong, she said, and in a few months it was
gone and she was as gay as a girl. She's what
they call a character, Mrs. Gaines is.</p>

<p>I don't want to be like her, and I don't expect
to do any groaning over leaving Yorkburg.
I want to live with Uncle Parke and
Miss Katherine, and I'm going to. But it's
strange how many happy things hurt.</p>

<h2>A REAL WEDDING</h2>


<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i.png" alt="I" title="I" /></div><p>
t looks as if everybody who knows
Miss Katherine wants her to be married
from their house. Her brothers
want her to be married from theirs.
Her aunt, Mrs. Powhatan Bloodgood,
who lives in Loudon County, and
whose husband is as rich as a real lord, begs
her to be married in hers; and everybody in
Yorkburg&mdash;I mean the coat-of-arms everybodies&mdash;has
invited her to have the wedding
in their home.</p>

<p>But she just smiles and says no to them all.
Says she is going to be married from her house,
which is the Orphan Asylum, though the ceremony
will be at the church. It's going to be
in the morning at twelve o'clock, so they can
take the two-o'clock train for Richmond and
go on to New York.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine wants it to be quiet, but it
can't be quiet. There's nothing on human
legs that can use them who won't be at the
church to see that wedding take place.</p>

<p>Everybody has been paying her a lot of
attention of late. It's real strange what a difference
a man makes in a marriage, even if he
isn't noticed much in person at the time. If
he's rich and prominent, everybody is so pleasant
and sociable you'd think they were real
intimate. If he's just good and poor, few take
notice.</p>

<p>When Miss Vickie Toones married Mr. Joe
Blake they didn't get hardly any presents.
They had a lot of dead relations who used to
be rich and haughty, but their living ones are
as poor as the people they didn't used to know,
and hardly anybody gave them anything handsome.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine's presents are just amazing,
and my eyes are blistered by the shine of them.
I didn't know before such things were in the
world. People say Uncle Parke has made a
lot of money in some mines out West, besides
being a doctor, and that he doesn't have to
work. "But a man who doesn't work hasn't
any excuse for living," I heard him tell somebody,
and maybe it's so, though I don't know.</p>

<p>I don't know anything these days. I'm the
shape and size of Mary Cary, but I see and
hear so many things I never saw and heard
before that I'd like to borrow a dog to see if
he knows whether I am myself or somebody
else. And another thing I'd like to find out
is, How do other people know so much?</p>

<p>Mrs. Philip Creekmore has a cousin whose
wife's brother lives in the same place Uncle
Parke does, and Miss Amelia Cokeland wrote
out there and found out all about him. But
it doesn't matter whether she truly knows anything
or not. Miss Webb says she is like those
fish scientists. Give her one bone, and she can
tell you all the rest. She's had a grand time
telling more things about Uncle Parke than
Miss Katherine will ever learn in this world.</p>

<p>My dress is finished. I'm to be Maiden of
Honor. There are no bridesmaids. Think of
it! Me, Mary Cary, once just flesh and blood
mechanical, now a living creature who is to
wear a white Swiss dress and a sash with pink
rosebuds on it, and walk up the church aisle
with my arms full of roses. And&mdash;magnificent
gloriousness! most beautiful of all!&mdash;every girl
in this Asylum is to have a white dress and a
sash the color she likes best to wear to the
wedding. That's my wedding gift to the girls.
Uncle Parke gave it to me.</p>

<p>Miss Katherine's California brother and his
wife have come. I don't like them. He looks
bored to death, and chews the end of his
mustache till you wonder there's any left. As
for her, she's the limit. Maybe that's what's
the matter with him.</p>

<p>She seems to be afraid some of us might
touch her, and she stares as if we were figures
in a china-shop. No more says good-morning
than if we were.</p>

<p>She wears seven rings on one hand and four
on another, and rustles so when she walks she
sounds like a churner out of order. If she isn't
a bulgarian born, she's bought herself into
being one, for she oozes money. It's the only
thing you think of when she's around. You
can actually smell it. I think Miss Katherine
is sorry they came. She don't say it, of course,
but plenty of things don't have to be said.</p>

<p>Uncle Parke came last night, bringing his
best friend and some others. The best one is
Doctor Willwood. He's fine. He and I are
going to come down the aisle together. I
reach up to his elbow, and he says he may
put me in his pocket. I wish he would. I
know I will be that frightened I'd be glad to
get in it.</p>

<p>He wants to know all about Yorkburg and
the people, and to-day Miss Bray let me take
him all around the town and show him the
antiquities. He asked her. I had on the white
dress Miss Katherine gave me last summer, and
I looked real nice, for I had on my company
manners, too.</p>

<p>You see, he was from the West, and had
never been to Virginia before; and when a man
comes such a long way, one ought to put on
company manners and be extra polite. It
wouldn't be right not to. I put mine on, and
I guess I did do a lot of talking. I'm by nature
a talker, just like I can't help skipping when
my heart is happy and nothing hurts.</p>

<p>I told him about all the places we came to,
and about who lived in them, except the Alden
house which the Reagans now possess. When
we got there he stopped in front of it.</p>

<p>"My!" he said, "that's a beautiful old place!
Whose is it?"</p>

<p>"Some people by the name of Reagan live
there," I said. "I don't know them." And
I started on.</p>

<p>I came near forgetting, and saying, "That
is Alden house, where my grandfather used to
live," but I remembered in time. I don't acknowledge
my grandfather, and I knew somebody
else would tell him Uncle Parke was born
and lived there until he went West.</p>

<p>We had a grand time. We stayed out over
four hours, and I forgot all about dinner. He
didn't want to go in when I suddenly remembered
and told him I must, and then he said
I was going to take dinner with him at the
Colonial. He'd asked Miss Bray, and it was
all right. And that's what I did. Took dinner
with him at the Colonial!</p>

<p>I tell you, Mary Martha Cary had what you
could truly call a Time. And Doctor Willwood
said he never had enjoyed a morning in his life
like that one. Laugh? I never heard a man
laugh so hearty. Half the time I couldn't tell
why. I'd be real serious, but he'd look at me
and almost die laughing. I bet I said some
things I oughtn't, but I don't remember, and
I couldn't take them back if I did.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It's over. The wedding is over. Everything
is after a while in this life, even death;
and time is the only thing that keeps on just
the same.</p>

<p>They're gone. Gone on their bridal tour,
and the happiness that's left Yorkburg would
run a family for a long life. I wish everybody
could have seen that wedding. It's going to
be long remembered, for the earth and sky,
and birds and flowers, and trees and sunshine
all took part. Everything tried to help, and
as for blessings on them, they took away
enough for the human race. But now it's over
I feel like my first balloon looked when I stuck
a pin in it to see what would happen. I saw.</p>

<p>I had a telegram from them to-day. It said:</p>

<blockquote><p>We sail at eleven o'clock. Love to all, and hearts
full for Mary Cary.</p>

<p>UNCLE PARKE and AUNT KATHERINE.</p></blockquote>

<p>Well, she's my Aunt now. That's fixed, anyhow,
and the marriage that fixed it was a
beauty. Every bird in Yorkburg was singing,
every flower was blooming, and every heart
was blessing; and when those fifty-eight
orphans walked in, all in white and two by
two, every hand was dropping roses. And that
is what each girl was wishing: Roses, roses all
her life!</p>

<p>After the ushers, I came in all alone by myself;
that is, my shape did. Mary was really
inside the altar looking at me coming up slow
and easy, and Martha was ordering me to keep
step to the music. "All right, I'm doing my
best," I was saying to both. And I was, but
I was thankful when I got to where I could
stop, for my legs were so excited I wouldn't
have been surprised if they'd turned and run
out.</p>

<p>Behind me came Miss Katherine, on her Army
brother's arm. He's as nice as the other isn't.
He hasn't got the money-making disease.
When Uncle Parke and Doctor Willwood came
out of the vestry-room Uncle Parke gave me
one look, just one, but it was so understanding
I winked back, and then he came farther down
and stood by Miss Katherine like she was his
until kingdom come, forever more. Amen.</p>

<p>Then the minister began, and the music was
so soft you could hear the birds outside. The
breeze through the window blew right on Miss
Katherine's veil, and I was so busy watching
it I didn't know the time had come to pray,
and I hardly got my head bent before I had
to take it up again. Then the minister was
through, and I was walking down the aisle
with Doctor Willwood, and in just about two
minutes more we were back at the Asylum,
and it was all over&mdash;the thing we'd been looking
forward to so long.</p>

<p>The Asylum looked real nice that morning.
There were bushels and bushels of flowers in it,
for everybody in town who had any sent them.
Flowers cover a multitude of poverties. The
reception was grand. That California Richness
called it a breakfast, but that was pure style.
Yorkburg don't have breakfast between twelve
and one, and everybody else called it a reception.
As for the people at it, there were more
kinds than were ever in one dining-room before;
and every single one had a good time.
Every one.</p>

<p>You see, Miss Katherine, besides being who
she was, was what she was. Having known a
great deal about all sorts of people since being
a nurse, and finding out that the plain and the
fancy, the rich and the poor, those who've had
a chance and those who haven't, are a heap
more alike than people think, she said she was
going to invite to her wedding whoever she
wanted. And she did.</p>

<p>There wasn't one invited who didn't come:
the bent and the broke and the blind (that's
true, for old Mr. Forbes is bent, and Mrs. Rowe's
hip was broken and she uses crutches, and
Bobbie Anderson is blind); and the old, that's
the high-born coat-of-arms kind; and the new,
that's the Reagans and Hinchmans and some
others, and Mr. Pinkert the shoemaker, who,
she says, is a gentleman if he don't remember
his grandfather's name; and Miss Ginnie Grant,
who made her underclothes&mdash;all were there.
All. It was a different wedding from any that
was ever before in Yorkburg, and if any feelings
were hurt it was because they were trying
to be. Some feelings are kept for that purpose.</p>

<p>Of course, Mrs. Christopher Pryor had remarks
to make. "Katherine always was too
independent," I heard her tell Miss Queechy
Spence. "But I don't believe in anything of
the kind. If you once let people get out of
the place they were born in, there'll be no doing
anything with them. You mark me, if this
wedding don't make trouble. Some of these
people will expect to be invited to my house
next." And she took another helping of salad
that was enough for three. She's an awful eater.</p>

<p>"Oh no, they won't," said Miss Queechy.
"They know better than to expect anything
like that of you," and she gave me a little wink
and walked off with Mr. Morris, who's her beau.
I went off, too. It isn't safe for Martha Cary
to be too near Mrs. Pryor, for Mary never
knows what she may do.</p>

<p>And, oh, you ought to have seen Miss Bray!
She was stepsister to the Queen of Sheba.
Solomon never had a wife arrayed like she was
on that twenty-seventh day of June. I believe
she is engaged to Doctor Rudd. I really do.</p>

<p>You see, after people got over teasing him
about that make-believe wedding, he got to
thinking about her. He's bound to know he
isn't much of a man, and no young girl would
have him, so lately he's been ambling 'round
Miss Bray. If he can stand her, he'll do well
to get her. She's a grand manager on little.</p>

<p>He was at the wedding, too. His beard was
flowinger and redder, and the part in the back
of his head shininger than ever. He had an
elegant time. He was so full of himself you
would have thought it was his own party.</p>

<p>Uncle Parke and Aunt Katherine have been
on the ocean three days. I wonder if they are
sick. I don't think I will go to Europe with
my children's father. I was seasick once on
land, and there wasn't a human being I even
liked that day. It would be bad to find out
so soon that the very sight of your husband
makes you ill. After you know him better,
you could tell him to go off somewhere; but at
first I suppose you have to be polite.</p>

<p>They were awful nice about wanting me to
go with them. The bride and groom were.
They said I had to, and they were so surprised
when I said I couldn't that they didn't think
I meant it. When they found out I did, they
were dreadfully worried, and didn't know what
to do next. There wasn't anything to do, and
here I am. Here I'm going to be, too, until
the first day of October, when they will be back,
and we will start for the West, for Michigan.</p>

<p>I'm going to like Michigan. I've decided
before I get there. I know there will be something
to like, there always is in every place
and every person, Miss Katherine says, if you
just will see it instead of the all wrong. I was
by nature born critical. There are a lot of
things I don't like in this world, but there's no
use in mentioning them. As for opinions, if
they're not pleasant they'd better be kept to
yourself. I learned that early in life and forget
it every day.</p>

<p>I'm going to try and think Michigan is a
grand place, and next to Virginia the best to
live in. They couldn't, <i>couldn't</i> expect me to
think it was like Virginia!</p>

<p>Perhaps, after a while, Uncle Parke may come
back. For over two hundred years his people
have lived here, and sometimes I believe he
feels just like that dog did who had his call in
him. The call of the place that the first dogs
came from, that wild, free place, and I think
Uncle Parke wants to come back, wants to be
with his own people.</p>

<p>Out West is very convenient, though, Peggy
Green says. She has an aunt who used to live
out there, and she told her you could do as you
choose in almost everything. If husbands and
wives didn't like each other, there was no
trouble in getting new ones. They could get
a divorce and marry somebody else.</p>

<p>I wonder what a divorce is. We've never
had one in Yorkburg, and I never knew until
the other day that when you got married it
wasn't really truly permanent. I thought it
was for ever and ever and until death parted.
The prayer-book says so, and I thought it
meant it.</p>

<p>By the time I'm grown I guess I'll find a lot
of things are said and not meant. Maybe when
I find out I will be all the gladder to come back
to Yorkburg, where people don't seem to know
much about these new-fashioned things. Where
they still believe in the old ones, and just live
on and don't hurry, and are kind and polite and
dear, if they are slow and queer and proud a
little bit.</p>

<p>It makes me have such a funny feeling in
my throat when I think about going away.
I'm trying not to think. But I do. Think all
the time. I want this summer to be the happiest
the children ever had. It's the last for
me. That sounds consumptive, but I don't
mean that way. I mean it's my last Orphan
summer.</p>

<p>Of course, I'm glad, awful glad; but I'm so
sorry the other children aren't going, too. For
them it's prunes and blue-and-white calico to
look forward to until they're eighteen. Year
in and year out, prunes and calico.</p>

<p>But maybe it isn't. If Mary Cary will do
her part something nicer may happen. She
doesn't know yet the way to make it happen,
having nothing much to send back but love.
Somebody says love finds the way. Oh, Mary
Cary, you and Love <i>must</i> find a way!</p>

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
